The security breach at Phemex_official is believed to have been caused by unauthorized access to the exchange&#x27;s hot wallet. Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack may have been orchestrated by actors from the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK).

IPC, a Token DeFi project, was exploited due to a vulnerability in the implementation of a function, leading to losses exceeding $0.59 million USD.</p><p>Exploit Details:
The exploit was a frontrun attack utilizing the Puissant: Payment method. The root cause of the vulnerability was found in the transfer() function, which burns tokens from the pair when selling. The function was supposed to include a timelock for transfers, preventing newly bought tokens from being sold for at least 30 minutes. However, the attacker managed to bypass this check by exploiting a logic error in the _isRemoveLP() function. This was achieved through flash swapping both tokens from the pair, allowing the attacker to circumvent the intended timelock.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user---031-million-loss">User - $0.31 Million Loss<a href="#user---031-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User - $0.31 Million Loss" title="Direct link to User - $0.31 Million Loss">​</a></h3><p>Attack type: Phishing</p><p>Throughout this quarter, multiple instances of users falling victim to phishing attacks were detected, resulting in total losses exceeding $0.31 million.</p><p>Two primary types of phishing transactions were observed:</p><ol><li><strong>Wallet Drainers</strong>: Scammers trick users into visiting phishing websites, where they are then deceived into signing transactions that transfer funds directly to the attackers.</li><li><strong>Spoofing Cases</strong>: Users are deceived into transferring funds to a recipient that appears to be legitimate but is actually a copycat.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fourmeme---031-million-loss">Four.meme - $0.31 Million Loss<a href="#fourmeme---031-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Four.meme - $0.31 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Four.meme - $0.31 Million Loss">​</a></h3><p>Incident Overview:
The Four.meme project was compromised twice this quarter, resulting in total losses of approximately $0.31 million worth of funds.</p><p>First Incident:</p><p>Date: February 11, 2025
Type: Business Logic Vulnerability Hack
Attack Process:
The attacker maliciously initialized the PancakeSwap V3 Pool with an extreme price, causing the pool price to tilt.
A migration transaction added liquidity at the price after malicious initialization: 1 Wei token + the rest of WBNB was added.
The attacker drained liquidity with a very small number of tokens and exchanged most of the WBNB.
Cause of Attack:
The platform contract neither created nor initialized the PancakeSwap V3 Pool in advance, nor did it check its sqrtPriceX96.
Second Incident:</p><p>Date: March 18, 2025
Type: Front Running Attack
Attack Process:
The hacker front ran by minting LP first, then once liquidity was added by the team, they immediately removed LP.
Analysis:
It appears that users did not exactly lose assets (their initial seeding funds are still in the Four.meme Multisig). The funds were lost in Four.meme&#x27;s wallet.
The principle is that initial seeded funds are added by users, and once it reaches a certain percentage, liquidity is added by Four.meme.
Hacker Analysis:
The hacker submitted the bundle through Bloxroute, and it might be possible to obtain some information from them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="badai---035-million-loss">BADAI - $0.35 Million Loss<a href="#badai---035-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BADAI - $0.35 Million Loss" title="Direct link to BADAI - $0.35 Million Loss">​</a></h3><p>Attack type: Lack of Validation</p><p>Date: February 20, 2025</p><p>Incident Overview:
