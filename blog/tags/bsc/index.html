This significant reduction indicates an overall improvement in the security situation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).</p><p>In 2023, the most damaging attack vector was rug pulls. However, in 2024, the most damaging attacks have shifted to price manipulation. This change underscores the critical need for web3 projects to avoid reliance on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools and not depend solely on the balance of tokens in a contract. It is essential to consider the risks associated with flash loans and direct transfers that can impact token prices. To enhance security, projects should consider using entity oracles like Chainlink for a secure price feed.</p><p>Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ol><li><strong>Understand What You&#x27;re Signing:</strong> Never blindly sign random signatures or transactions. Always ensure signatures are from official websites.</li><li><strong>Verify Official Websites:</strong> Double-check that you are on the official website of the DApp.</li><li><strong>Exercise Caution with New/Trending Projects:</strong> Be wary of projects that guarantee high APYs or use MEV bots.

They have been documented relatively well on Web3 newsletters and by security companies in the space.
However, we noticed that scammers are recently changing some of their techniques, hence we decided to write this blog to offer more understanding of this scam.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recap">Recap<a href="#recap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recap" title="Direct link to Recap">​</a></h2><p>This is how the scam typically work:</p><ol><li>A user notices an unknown airdropped token in his wallet, usually it mimics a valuable or well known token like USDT. In other cases, it might be the latest trends like Friend.Tech.</li><li>He then proceeds to “approve” it to a DEX router such as PancakeSwap, in hopes of selling it for a profit. Subsequently, he tries to swap it on the DEX but to no avail as the transaction reverts. But didn’t he already grant approval for the DEX?</li><li>At the same time, he notices that the token is still in his wallet and he lost some BNB as well. He was scammed!</li></ol><p><strong>What actually happens</strong> is that when the user interacts with the unknown token at step 2, the token inadvertently took his gas provided in the transaction to create gas tokens. Furthermore, the gas requested in the transaction will be at unusually high costs.</p><p>1 popular instance of gas tokens on BSC is the CHI Gas token, you can refer to this <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-chi-gastoken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> here for more information. Essentially, they are tokens that utilize the “gas refund” feature of the EVM that allows refunds when clearing storage. This allows users to mint gas tokens when fees are low, and burn them when fees are high, effectively &quot;locking in&quot; the lower fee.</p><p>In other words, the victim is minting CHI Gas tokens for the scammer so they can reduce their gas costs in future transactions.</p><p><strong>New variations of the scam:</strong></p><ol><li>Other common ERC20 methods invoke the same scam. For e.g, trying to move the token using the “transfer” method will lead to users invoking the minting too.</li><li>Recently, we noticed that scammers now prefer to mint XEN tokens with the victim’s gas during the transaction.</li></ol><p>For context, XEN is a social mining project based on a Proof of Participation mechanism. XEN tokens are minted using gas as well, and the tokens can only be claimed after a waiting period. XEN tokens do have value in the secondary market. Therefore, scammers can profit by gaining these XEN tokens from you and dumping them later.</p><ol start="3"><li>Creating fake approvals. This is not exactly new but we would like to elaborate more on how it works. </li></ol><p>Revoke product platforms like <a href="https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bscscan</a> or <a href="https://debank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debank</a> naively log all approval events related to your wallet. Then, they are displayed nicely in a dashboard for you to see.
However, the issue is that approval events can actually be faked by the scammers.</p><p>Let’s look at this example:
BscScan approver check:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-1" src="/hashdit/assets/images/1-fb120f830a82c590938f6fdbe9e80a0a.png" width="512" height="464" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On first glance,
it looks like this user has multiple unlimited allowance for their tokens. However these are all not real (the token and the approval).

The real INJ token address is 0x<strong>a2b</strong>726b1145a4773f68593cf171187d8ebe4d<strong>495</strong>. *Notice that the token address prefix and suffix are scarily similar to trick victims.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-landscape-of-scammers-methodologies">Current landscape of scammers’ methodologies<a href="#current-landscape-of-scammers-methodologies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current landscape of scammers’ methodologies" title="Direct link to Current landscape of scammers’ methodologies">​</a></h2><p>Understanding when and how scammers create these scam opportunities will help us be more familiar and to better avoid them.</p><ol><li><p>Cast a wide-net</p><ul><li><p>By airdropping fake notable tokens like USDT or USDC to victims’ wallets</p></li><li><p>Then by creating fake approval transactions for fake notable tokens like USDT or USDC, which are displayed on revoke pages like <a href="https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bscscan</a>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Wait for specific events</p><ul><li>A hack event happened, airdrop / create fake approval transactions for the related hack project token / spender, so that users will ‘revoke’ them. For example, a particular project named &quot;A&quot; has been hacked, the scammers will mint and create a fake approval with a fake token &quot;A&quot; to the real &quot;A&quot; holders. As users are taught to revoke access for their &quot;A&quot; tokens, they see that there is an approval for the fake token &quot;A&quot; as well, promptly getting scammed of their gas.</li></ul></li></ol><p>For all cases, scammers ensure that the gas provided is enough to mint the scammers’ desired amount of CHI gas tokens or XEN tokens. I.e if the gas is too low, the scam transaction will likely revert.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="security-recommendations-from-hashdit">Security Recommendations from HashDit<a href="#security-recommendations-from-hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security Recommendations from HashDit" title="Direct link to Security Recommendations from HashDit">​</a></h2><ol><li>Do not touch any new unknown tokens.

The ippswap project executed a concerning action by exploiting a privileged backdoor method, takeToken(), within the staking contract. This unauthorized maneuver allowed the project party to transfer IPPSwap LP Tokens, which had been staked by users, directly to their own account.  Liquidity was then subsequently removed using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT.</p><p>Some of the USDT funds flowed onto Binance exchange where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safemoon---89-million-loss">Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss<a href="#safemoon---89-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>The Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.</p><p>On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, and transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, taxing the remaining 20% as a bounty.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="swapx---73-million-loss">SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss<a href="#swapx---73-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>SwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they have not used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they have not revoked their approvals.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantis-loans---35-million-loss">Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss<a href="#atlantis-loans---35-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the core team whichresulted in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.</p><p>However, a similar proposal was submitted on June 12, and was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved the Atlantis Loans core contracts.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fut---27-million-loss">$FUT - $2.7 Million Loss<a href="#fut---27-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>Early this year on 4-Jan-2023, the $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD. The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circulate---23-million-loss">Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss<a href="#circulate---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team’s address.</p><p>Although it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract.
On the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yieldrobot---21-million-loss">YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss<a href="#yieldrobot---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss" title="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scammed users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.
Two days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.</p><p>In order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user’s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.</p><p>The new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract’s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="liango-protocol---16-million-loss">LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss<a href="#liango-protocol---16-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss" title="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.</p><p>The reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. </p><p>Based on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer’s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.</p><p>Then on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project’s back end system.</p><p>The administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. </p><p>Then the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.</p><p>Then the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deusdao-dei---13-million-loss">DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss<a href="#deusdao-dei---13-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.</p><p>The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts. However, it is undeniable that 2023 H1 has proven to be a challenging year for both investors and developers due to the continued bear market trend and exploit incidents. Below we have some final advice for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ul><li>Understand what you&#x27;re signing, do not blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)</li><li>Always double check that you are on the official website of the dApp</li><li>Be wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity</li><li>Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)</li><li>Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done</li><li>Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
If <em>High Risk</em> is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away</li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!</strong></p><p>For developers:</p><ul><li>Verify &amp; open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)</li><li>Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)</li><li>Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure</li><li>Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases</li><li>Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations</li><li>Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary</li><li>Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)</li><li>Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)</li><li>Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hashdit">Hashdit<a href="#hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hashdit" title="Direct link to Hashdit">​</a></h4><p>HashDit’s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors, helping them to make informed decisions.

However, due to BSC’s decentralization nature and its fast growth to more than 1200 DApps, more bad actors have been attracted to the space as well. As such, security incidents have generally been on a rising trend.</p><p>This section aims to describe the security incidents YoY from 2020 to 2022.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general">General<a href="#general" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General" title="Direct link to General">​</a></h4><p>According to our statistics, in 2022, there were 282 security incidents on BSC which have increased by 228% YoY from 2021.

This shows that the number of security exploits with high financial impact is decreasing. Such decrease could be explained by the fact that projects with important funds are better secured and are more battle-tested. As such, malicious actors seem to be focusing their efforts on projects with more modest funds, concluding in lesser value exploits.</p><p>This pie chart shows a better understanding of the financial losses over the year with 2022 accounting for 57.84% of the total financial loss across, 2021 being 42.10% and 2020 with a mere 0.07%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-5" src="/hashdit/assets/images/financial_loss_annual-a3d9b71988d9d3611588f66bec19d3fb.png" width="1528" height="925" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 5: Financial losses in % over the last 3 years</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-attack-vectors">Type of attack vectors<a href="#type-of-attack-vectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of attack vectors" title="Direct link to Type of attack vectors">​</a></h4><p>According to our statistics, this is the breakdown of the general attack vectors from 2020 - 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-6" src="/hashdit/assets/images/general_attack_type-06c8c7e1079f1a0734619b4e8c3d4779.png" width="1528" height="729" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 6: Number of incidents per attack vector over the last 3 years</p><p>It can be seen that crypto scams (in green) are a growing concern on the BSC, with 167 in 2022, a 328% increase YoY.

Hackers took notice of this trend and targeted vulnerabilities within these cross-chain bridge smart contracts.</p><p>The 2nd most project type targeted was DeFi projects at 37.06%, followed by GameFi and Metaverse projects at 1.22% and 1.08% respectively.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-14" src="/hashdit/assets/images/financial_loss_per_project_type_distribution-d9c0ff9ec470298e253d672bf7b6ba2e.png" width="1528" height="995" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 14: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-10-incidents-in-2022">Top 10 incidents in 2022<a href="#top-10-incidents-in-2022" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022" title="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022">​</a></h4><p>The following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial loss in 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-15" src="/hashdit/assets/images/top_10_incidents_bsc-33b1dc84d82454cb8b3c3c998ce85eb2.png" width="1528" height="925" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 15: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2022 on the BNB Smart Chain</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-10-incidents-in-2022-1">Top 10 incidents in 2022<a href="#top-10-incidents-in-2022-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022" title="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bsc-token-hub-exploit---572-million-loss">BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss<a href="#bsc-token-hub-exploit---572-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss" title="Direct link to BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 6th October 2022, BSC Token hub, a bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain and the BNB Smart Chain, was exploited by an attacker resulting in the unauthorized transfer of 2M BNB.</p><p>Root cause analysis confirmed a flaw in the verification algorithm implementation developed by Cosmos, and incorporated by BSC into their contract’s proof verification process. Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn’t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="qubitfinance---80-million-loss">QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss<a href="#qubitfinance---80-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss" title="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.</p><p>Root cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).</p><p>The legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evodefi---50-million-loss">EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss<a href="#evodefi---50-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss" title="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>The team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) &amp; Polygon, invested users’ funds on Terra’s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.</p><p>However, due to the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.</p><p>Thus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users’ funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund’s value.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablefund---23-million-loss">StableFund - $23 Million Loss<a href="#stablefund---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss" title="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>StableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.</p><p>In reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.</p><p>The project started from 2022-06-27, where &gt;13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elephant-money---22-million-loss">Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss<a href="#elephant-money---22-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.</p><p>The root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transit-finance---21-million-loss">Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss<a href="#transit-finance---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for &gt; $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.</p><p>Thankfully, &gt; $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).</p><p>The root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ankr--helio---20-million-loss">ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss<a href="#ankr--helio---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for &gt; $15m, bringing the total damage to &gt; $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.</p><p>Helio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform’s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss">Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss<a href="#racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.</p><p>For Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.</p><p>For the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flare---17-million-loss">$FLARE - $17 Million Loss<a href="#flare---17-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the &quot;balance&quot; related data structure.</p><p>The project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this “balance” related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.</p><p>However, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss">DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss<a href="#dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m. The hacker compromised multiple private keys of the team. As a result, the hacker removed liquidity from the projects and stole all funds from their hot wallets. The funds have already been bridged to ETH chain and deposited into Tornado Cash.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h3><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transactions. However, it is undeniable that 2022 has proven to be a tough year for both investors and developers due to the bear market and hack incidents, which impeded trust within the cryptocurrency community. Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ul><li>Understand what you&#x27;re signing, don&#x27;t blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)</li><li>Always double check that you are on the official website of the DApp</li><li>Be extra wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity</li><li>Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)</li><li>Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done</li><li>Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
If <em>High Risk</em> is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away</li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!</strong></p><p>For developers:</p><ul><li>Verify &amp; open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)</li><li>Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)</li><li>Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure</li><li>Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases</li><li>Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations</li><li>Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary</li><li>Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)</li><li>Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)</li><li>Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hashdit">Hashdit<a href="#hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hashdit" title="Direct link to Hashdit">​</a></h4><p>HashDit’s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.

In the context of blockchain, it is exploiting vulnerabilities in fundamental components of DApps and in the blockchain infrastructure. The non-exhaustive list of components can be: blockchain bridges, oracles, crypto wallets, Frontend/backend application and smart contracts which are deployed on-chain. Examples include business logic issues and lack of validation.</li><li>At times, it could be compromising the private keys of project teams through traditional attack vectors.</li></ul></li><li><p>Scams</p><ul><li><p>Scams are Web3 projects that do not intend to deliver promised features. Indeed, they usually entice users to invest or participate in the project with the only intent of keeping their invested money and leaving the users hanging.</p></li><li><p>Scams could be executed by dumping tokens, stealing all the invested funds, through means like sending sketchy emails and websites, or creating fake accounts on social media.
