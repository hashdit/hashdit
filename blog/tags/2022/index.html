In contrast, in 2022, this value dropped to just $3.7m - even when there were several considerable events that represent almost half of the stolen funds. This shows that the number of security exploits with high financial impact is decreasing. Such decrease could be explained by the fact that projects with important funds are better secured and are more battle-tested. As such, malicious actors seem to be focusing their efforts on projects with more modest funds, concluding in lesser value exploits.</p><p>This pie chart shows a better understanding of the financial losses over the year with 2022 accounting for 57.84% of the total financial loss across, 2021 being 42.10% and 2020 with a mere 0.07%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-5" src="/hashdit/assets/images/financial_loss_annual-a3d9b71988d9d3611588f66bec19d3fb.png" width="1528" height="925" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 5: Financial losses in % over the last 3 years</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-attack-vectors">Type of attack vectors<a href="#type-of-attack-vectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of attack vectors" title="Direct link to Type of attack vectors">​</a></h4><p>According to our statistics, this is the breakdown of the general attack vectors from 2020 - 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-6" src="/hashdit/assets/images/general_attack_type-06c8c7e1079f1a0734619b4e8c3d4779.png" width="1528" height="729" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 6: Number of incidents per attack vector over the last 3 years</p><p>It can be seen that crypto scams (in green) are a growing concern on the BSC, with 167 in 2022, a 328% increase YoY.

Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn’t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="qubitfinance---80-million-loss">QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss<a href="#qubitfinance---80-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss" title="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.</p><p>Root cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).</p><p>The legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evodefi---50-million-loss">EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss<a href="#evodefi---50-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss" title="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>The team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) &amp; Polygon, invested users’ funds on Terra’s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.</p><p>However, due to the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.</p><p>Thus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users’ funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund’s value.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablefund---23-million-loss">StableFund - $23 Million Loss<a href="#stablefund---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss" title="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>StableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.</p><p>In reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.</p><p>The project started from 2022-06-27, where &gt;13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elephant-money---22-million-loss">Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss<a href="#elephant-money---22-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.</p><p>The root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transit-finance---21-million-loss">Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss<a href="#transit-finance---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for &gt; $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.</p><p>Thankfully, &gt; $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).</p><p>The root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ankr--helio---20-million-loss">ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss<a href="#ankr--helio---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for &gt; $15m, bringing the total damage to &gt; $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.</p><p>Helio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform’s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss">Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss<a href="#racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.</p><p>For Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.</p><p>For the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flare---17-million-loss">$FLARE - $17 Million Loss<a href="#flare---17-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the &quot;balance&quot; related data structure.</p><p>The project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this “balance” related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.</p><p>However, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss">DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss<a href="#dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m. The hacker compromised multiple private keys of the team. As a result, the hacker removed liquidity from the projects and stole all funds from their hot wallets. The funds have already been bridged to ETH chain and deposited into Tornado Cash.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h3><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transactions.

Most of its success is no mere temporary surge because of the developer-friendly application development process. Google offers a plethora of platforms that support the design and development, testing, and sharing of their applications. Consequently, the number of applications in the Google Play Store reached 2.6 million in 2022. </p><p>However, to put that another way, from a security standpoint, the remarkable growth of Android coupled with the fact that a large number of innocent mobile users may become potential victims of cyber attacks. One of the prevalent types of attack is something called repackaging. Repackaging refers to the practice of customizing an existing mobile app and redistributing it in the wild. Specifically, attackers modify a popular app downloaded from app markets, reverse-engineer the app, inject some malicious code, and redistribute the modified app. Because it is difficult for regular users to notice the difference between the repackaged app and the original app, victims may suffer financial loss, mainly when security-critical private and business apps they use, such as Crypto Exchange apps, are repackaged.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repackaged-android-apps">Repackaged Android Apps<a href="#repackaged-android-apps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Repackaged Android Apps" title="Direct link to Repackaged Android Apps">​</a></h2><p>Some may get astounded by the fact that Android app is prone to repackaging. We can say that Android is negligent in such an attack. That&#x27;s because of the intrinsical relation to the structural characteristics of the app distribution process. The app requires &quot;ANY&quot; valid signature to be successfully installed — they do not verify the actual identity of the signer. The app developer (even including the bad actor!) does not need a legitimate public key certificate issued by a trusted authority, indicating the possibility that an actor can modify an existing app, inject some harmful codes, and re-sign it with the self-generated private key. </p><p>What happens when you have installed the repackaged app on your mobile device?

The apksigner tool, available in revision 24.0.3 and higher of the Android SDK Build Tools, lets you sign APKs and confirm that an APK&#x27;s signature will be verified successfully on all Android platform-supported versions by that APK. Make a comparison between the original and repackaged versions — you may immediately sense the difference.</p><p>The syntax for confirming the successful verification of an APK&#x27;s signature on supported platforms is as follows:</p><p><code>apksigner verify [options] app-name.apk</code></p><p>The apksigner verify command has the following options.</p><p><strong>--print-certs</strong></p><p>Show information about the APK&#x27;s signing certificates.</p><p><strong>--min-sdk-version &lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The lowest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK&#x27;s signature will be verified. Higher values allow the tool to use more robust security parameters when signing the app but limit the APK&#x27;s availability to devices running more recent versions of Android. By default, apksigner uses the value of the minSdkVersion attribute from the app&#x27;s manifest file.</p><p><strong>--max-sdk-version &lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The highest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK&#x27;s signature will be verified. By default, the tool uses the highest possible API level.</p><p><strong>-v, --verbose</strong></p><p>Use the verbose output mode.</p><p><strong>-Werr</strong></p><p>Treat warnings as errors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>You should only trust apps obtained from official app stores. Suppose you ever downloaded the Binance app from third-party markets or have already installed it. In that case, you are probably at risk — immediate action is required: change your password, factory reset your device, fresh-install it from our official host, and please contact us for assistance.</p><p>Other apps also can be a potential backdoor. Once you use the repackaged app, the lousy actor can annoy you in countless programmatically unimaginable ways. Telegram is a good example: Hashdit once ever stumbled across an unofficial Telegram app replacing crypto wallet addresses with the bad actors&#x27; ones on-the-fly.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/web-3-security">web3-security</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/repackage">repackage</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/2022">2022</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="Back in 2021, crypto scams were a growing attack vector tricking victims into investing in the crypto space.

Here are the most popular scams this year:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-phishing-link-scams">1: Phishing Link Scams<a href="#1-phishing-link-scams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1: Phishing Link Scams" title="Direct link to 1: Phishing Link Scams">​</a></h3><p>Phishing is already a popular technique used by scammers in Web 2. This is because scammers can just create a malicious website and subsequently mass send the links to their victims. Here, we will focus mostly on ways that the scammers will try to steal your private keys. </p><p>In Web 3, scammers usually send their phishing links through different mediums where the Web3 community is, like Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and even On-Chain.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-2" src="/hashdit/assets/images/2-6eb7c3d28234f88d42485308433b0316.png" width="512" height="131" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Phishing websites usually look like the real website, but with different url names. They can be about a new giveaway or NFT pre-mint events, basically any situation that will make the user feel excited (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out) and not think straight. The scammer takes advantage of the user’s emotional instability.</p><p>They can blatantly be asking for the user to provide his seed phrase or private key. For example, contacting  users on  social media,reaching out as wallet software support and jumping in with direct messages spoofing as an Exchange Support to steal one’s private key directly.</p><p>Another way is that scammers will develop chrome extensions that look similar to legitimate ones like Metamask. By impersonating the real applications, users often are led to letting their guard down and provide their private key to use the new application.</p><p>One interesting tactic we noticed is that scammers will also try to trick users into thinking there is a new bug/vulnerability with existing applications and there is a new software upgrade. We detected a scammer trying to trick users into thinking the current Metamask version had a bug and users should upgrade to the new version. The scammer proclaimed in the message that the new upgrade is not out yet so the upgrade has to be done manually this time. He afterwards gave a set of instructions which aims to trick the user into providing his metamask password which will expose his private key to the scammer.</p><p>In this scenario, users should always wait for the official announcement from Metamask and upgrade their Metamask version from official sources.</p><p>To upgrade an extension, just head to chrome://extensions/ </p><p>Click on the update button</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-3" src="/hashdit/assets/images/3-6b4a6e12e3286d913865d9ee6d519f95.png" width="512" height="148" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This will update all your extensions accordingly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-friendly-reminder">A friendly reminder:<a href="#a-friendly-reminder" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A friendly reminder:" title="Direct link to A friendly reminder:">​</a></h5><p>Normal application upgrades WILL NOT require a user to provide sensitive information such as login credentials. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-ice-phishing">2: Ice-Phishing<a href="#2-ice-phishing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2: Ice-Phishing" title="Direct link to 2: Ice-Phishing">​</a></h3><p>This is a tactic where the user is tricked into signing a transaction that gives an attacker control over the user’s tokens, without the leakage of his private keys. This is an extension of the Phishing technique.</p><p>For some background, when a user is using DeFi applications (e.g PancakeSwap) and interacting with the main token standards (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155) the approval method is shown on their metamask window. This is a request for the user to delegate authority to a 3rd party to act on behalf of that user on those tokens. Afterwards, the user can perform other operations like performing a swap.</p><p>Attackers will direct users to the phishing website and induce them to sign some transactions that they didn&#x27;t request. For example, the interacted contract might not even be a contract, but the attacker’s address. Once the approval transaction is done, the attacker has the authority to transfer funds out of the victim’s wallet.</p><p>Usually, the scam website has an algorithm to scan the victim’s wallet to detect the valuable assets such as an expensive BAYC NFT or cryptocurrencies like WBTC or WETH. Often, the website will continually show the metamask window to prompt users to sign another transaction even though they may have already signed once.</p><p>Another way to prevent being a victim of Ice-Phishing is to stay away from signing eth_sign transactions. They usually look something like this: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-4" src="/hashdit/assets/images/4-3c0c1ee97c3cf13145e1c0896e83c06c.png" width="344" height="489" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The method eth_sign is an open-ended signing method that allows signing an arbitrary hash, which means it can be used to sign unclear transactions, or any other data, making it a dangerous phishing risk.</p><p>An arbitrary hash here means that the usual suspects of approve or approve for all methods are not the only possible methods, the scammer can make you sign transactions like native token transfer or a contract call. Essentially, having almost full control of your account without even holding your private key!</p><p>Although MetaMask will display a risk warning when signing eth_sign requests, when combined with other phishing techniques, it can still be possible for users with no security experience to fall for these traps.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-event-spoofing--nft-sleep-minting">3: Event Spoofing &amp; NFT Sleep Minting<a href="#3-event-spoofing--nft-sleep-minting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3: Event Spoofing &amp; NFT Sleep Minting" title="Direct link to 3: Event Spoofing &amp; NFT Sleep Minting">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-spoofing">Event Spoofing<a href="#event-spoofing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Event Spoofing" title="Direct link to Event Spoofing">​</a></h4><p>Event spoofing is a tactic where scammers transfer random BEP20 tokens to users, and prompt users to interact with it. The catch is that even though the scammer is the one transferring the tokens, from the blockchain explorer like BscScan, it will show that the source of funds were from a separate wallet such as Binance Hot Wallet. Then, they will be enticed to interact with these new ‘free’ tokens which can lead to users to phishing websites by displaying a link in the token name or the code itself.

If the _from address is changed to another address for e.g 0xhashdit, then BscScan will display the CHI being sent from 0xhashdit to the receiving address. Note: this isn’t particularly a bug with blockchain explorers, but more of the flexibility to change parameters since BscScan cannot know for sure whether the parameters are accurate. As such, scammers can use this to their advantage and spoof the source of funds.</p><p>Look at our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1557536292979855360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> for such an example! </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-sleep-minting">NFT Sleep Minting<a href="#nft-sleep-minting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NFT Sleep Minting" title="Direct link to NFT Sleep Minting">​</a></h4><p>Building on plain BEP20 event spoofing, scammers can be creative with how they execute their scam. NFT Sleep Minting is when a scammer mints an NFT directly to a famous creator’s wallet. However, the NFT code has a backdoor method where the scammer can reclaim the NFT back. This creates the appearance that (1) the famous creator authentically minted an NFT to themselves; and then (2) sent that NFT to a scammer. Based on the “on-chain” provenance, the scammer can claim they own an NFT minted by a famous creator and sell it for a higher value, faking the value in the process.</p><p>The deception of Sleep Minting comes from the fact that you can emit any piece of data in an Event log. One would expect that if the user sends a transaction to transfer an NFT, then your address should be in the Event log as the “from” field. However, that is not the case when a scammer reclaims a sleep-minted NFT from a famous creator. A scammer could artificially place the famous creator’s address in a Transfer Events “from” field, completing the illusion.</p><p>For exmaple, we can take a look at Beeple&#x27;s <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6b0562605d35ee710138402b878ffe6f2e23807#tokentxnsErc721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account</a> and observe several NFTS minted to him, and not exactly minted by him.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-ponzi-scams">4: Ponzi Scams<a href="#4-ponzi-scams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4: Ponzi Scams" title="Direct link to 4: Ponzi Scams">​</a></h3><p>In these scams, there is usually no real strategy to earn rewards or make profits. Essentially, the whole scheme uses the money of new investors to pay the old investors. Once there is no more new money coming in to support the scheme, the whole system will fail.</p><p>There are several telltale signs in a Crypto Ponzi Scam:</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-the-project-side-collects-tax-fees-and-these-fees-keep-users-longer-in-the-ecosystem">First, the project side collects tax fees and these fees keep users longer in the ecosystem.<a href="#first-the-project-side-collects-tax-fees-and-these-fees-keep-users-longer-in-the-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First, the project side collects tax fees and these fees keep users longer in the ecosystem." title="Direct link to First, the project side collects tax fees and these fees keep users longer in the ecosystem.">​</a></h5><p>Since every deposit/compounding action incurs some sort of fees, this means that the user has to compound for a longer period of time in order to break even. These fees are also used to pay back the dividends of the users who want to claim. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-there-is-no-way-to-withdraw-the-users-initial-invested-funds">Second, there is no way to withdraw the user&#x27;s initial invested funds.<a href="#second-there-is-no-way-to-withdraw-the-users-initial-invested-funds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Second, there is no way to withdraw the user&#x27;s initial invested funds." title="Direct link to Second, there is no way to withdraw the user&#x27;s initial invested funds.">​</a></h5><p>Once one user deposits their initial tokens, there is no way for him to withdraw back his initial invested funds. The only way for the user to get back any funds is to claim back dividends. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-third-way-is-using-a-referral-system">The third way is using a referral system.<a href="#the-third-way-is-using-a-referral-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The third way is using a referral system." title="Direct link to The third way is using a referral system.">​</a></h5><p>The project encourages participants to actively promote and refer others through the referrer benefits. The upline will receive additional rewards whenever a downline performs certain actions. Also, in order for a user to start participating in the protocol, he has to have an upline address to start. This creates a system where each address is linked to another, similar to a pyramid scheme. There are increased bonuses for having more than 5 downline addresses too.</p><p>A common theme that one will see is a steep rise in funds locked in the contract at the start, usually driven by the initial hype through marketing by the team or funds pumped by the team themselves to generate activity. Once the contract’s balance has reached an inflection point, this means there are no new funds coming in. This will slowly result in the scheme falling apart and the new investors panicking to withdraw as much dividends as possible.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-7" src="/hashdit/assets/images/7-dcce16bd7e1505d8598e8de18f327eec.png" width="512" height="237" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the end of the day, the project party which solely earns the tax fees will be the biggest beneficiary for such Ponzi scam projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-chi-gas-token-farming">5: CHI Gas token farming<a href="#5-chi-gas-token-farming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5: CHI Gas token farming" title="Direct link to 5: CHI Gas token farming">​</a></h3><p>CHI Gas token is an initiative by 1inch project, where the Chi Gastoken is a BEP20 token that is meant to be used on 1inch exchange to pay transaction costs. Chi is pegged to the network’s gas price. When the gas price is low, the Chi price is also low, and the opposite. </p><p>How scammers make use of this is very interesting. First, they would airdrop a bunch of random BEP20 tokens. When the user approves PancakeSwap to sell these tokens, in the approve() method of these tokens it will hard coded to consume a large amount (e.g above 90%) of the user&#x27;s gas limit to mint Chi Gastoken which can be used to subsidize the gas fee, the minted Chi Gastoken are the profit of the scammers. </p><p>It is recommended to pay attention to the consumed condition of gas fee in approval transactions before calling the approve() function in some airdrop tokens.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-general-dont-touch-random-tokens-airdropped-to-you">In general, don’t touch random tokens airdropped to you<a href="#in-general-dont-touch-random-tokens-airdropped-to-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In general, don’t touch random tokens airdropped to you" title="Direct link to In general, don’t touch random tokens airdropped to you">​</a></h5><p>Look at our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1573330966969720835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> for such an example!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-mev-scams--scam-events">6: MEV Scams / Scam Events<a href="#6-mev-scams--scam-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6: MEV Scams / Scam Events" title="Direct link to 6: MEV Scams / Scam Events">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crypto-jargon">Crypto Jargon<a href="#crypto-jargon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Crypto Jargon" title="Direct link to Crypto Jargon">​</a></h4><p>Scammers will make use of crypto jargon like “MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)”, “Arbitrage trading bot”, “Sniper bot”, “Front-run bot” promising passive income of a few thousand dollars a day to entice users to participate. These are usually promoted on platforms like Twitter, Tiktok and Blockchain Explorers.</p><p>Usually, scammers will attach a video link to the post where victims are brought to video hosting platforms like Youtube and Vimeo.</p><p>Example:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/8-b6e359ba54338512b3374ad06d7c1b78.png" width="512" height="396" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Essentially, the scam video will guide the user to deploy their malicious code using the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remix IDE</a>, they will provide the malicious code usually in a pastebin url in the video description. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-9" src="/hashdit/assets/images/9-0f8d752a84affbe63959b6bb09185835.png" width="291" height="164" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With the code now deployed on-chain, the user will be instructed to next prepare some native funds to perform the ‘front run or arbitrage’. The scam video will prompt the user to prepare more native funds so that when you perform the ‘front run or arbitrage’ operation, you will be able to make more profits, tricking the user. Once the user injects the funds into the contract and ‘starts the front run’, instead of earning him profits like what the scammer claims to do, the funds will be directly transferred to the scammer</p><p>Another relatively new way is for scammers to provide a link for CEX (Centralized Exchange) trading bots such as the screenshot here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-10" src="/hashdit/assets/images/10-ef6508347805a96c36af39aef5621f25.png" width="512" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Users will be prompted to download a malicious file and follow the instructions. Usually, users that want to trade on Binance Exchange automatically will have an API key. This scam video tricks users into using their trading bot and asking users to give up their API key and the password for it. Once the user is scammed into doing so, the scammer will be able to receive the user’s credentials on their end and trade with the user’s funds now.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crypto-event">Crypto Event<a href="#crypto-event" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Crypto Event" title="Direct link to Crypto Event">​</a></h4><p>In such situations, scammers also use social media to spread fake information of a giveaway being done by notable players in the space such as crypto exchanges or projects.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-11" src="/hashdit/assets/images/11-df614a07eda4ac91b0def2b8ca11a9f1.png" width="512" height="304" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Users will be prompted to enter this link and are instructed to “verify” their address first. In order to so, they have to send some BTC or BNB to the specified address and in return they will get back 10x of the amount. At the same time, the scam website shows a transaction history of the giveaway records to trick users into thinking that the giveaway is real and works. However in reality, once the crypto is sent by the user, the funds will be lost to the scammer and there will be no rewards to receive in the end. </p><p>Oftentimes, scammers might use old videos or even resort to deep faking a popular figure, to trick users into thinking that the person is endorsing and promoting a new giveaway. When in reality, this cannot be further away from the truth.</p><p>A common similarity among these cases is that there will be fake engagement in the video’s comment section. This is to psychologically trick users into thinking that this trading bot really works well.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-12" src="/hashdit/assets/images/12-0ef4367a8820ffe0cf7fa3cc77c790e4.png" width="401" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Also, if this is in the description, <strong>RUN</strong>.
