Method: The liquidity of the BASE tokens were held by an EOA account, hence the account could remove liquidity at any time.
Although the Base network is meant to be used for developer testing, some people have tried to trade on the network before its official launch

Since removing liquidity though, he has appeared to still be adding/removing small chunks of liquidity (probably still trying to garner traffic)

The MPC account had authority over the bridged funds of users, and transferred all the funds to his own wallet, on 3 chains: Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche. Since the MPC account appears as a normal EOA on-chain, it is unclear how the MPC account was compromised on the backend.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defrost---12-million-scam"><a href="https://twitter.com/Defrost_Finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defrost</a> - $12 Million Scam<a href="#defrost---12-million-scam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to defrost---12-million-scam" title="Direct link to defrost---12-million-scam">​</a></h3><p>The Defrost project was rugged for a total of $12 million USD on 23-Dec-2022. The incident happened on Avalanche.
Method: The privileged owner was an EOA which could change the address of the oracle, in a market contract. He changed the address maliciously to one that returns fake prices, to liquidate their users and seize their funds.
At that point of time, it looked pretty obvious that it was a rugpull. However, the project party claimed that they were hacked 4 days later and stated that the exploiter has returned 100% of funds to them <a href="https://medium.com/@Defrost_Finance/hacked-funds-returned-to-defrost-71b9d2d1b458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://medium.com/@Defrost_Finance/hacked-funds-returned-to-defrost-71b9d2d1b458</a>

The incident happened on Avalanche.
Root cause: The project party overlooked the EmergencyWithdraw() method and forgot to include a check for borrowed funds <a href="https://twitter.com/danielvf/status/1626340324103663617?s=61&amp;t=gr5sMl7K7qjCB7l3zmh53w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/danielvf/status/1626340324103663617?s=61&amp;t=gr5sMl7K7qjCB7l3zmh53w</a>

Root cause: The protocol did not have proper measures to manage price changes during operations that shift liquidity.
This oversight allows the protocol&#x27;s own liquidity to be put into a distorted price range, which allows attackers to make &quot;profit&quot; via a reverse swap.
Method: 1) The hacker initially flash loaned 10,000 WETH
2) Subsequently swaps them for $JIMBO, inflating its price
3) Called the shift() method in JimboController to manipulate reserves and imbalance the pool
4) Following the manipulation, the attacker converted the acquired Jimbo tokens back into ETH</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exactly---732-million-exploit"><a href="https://twitter.com/ExactlyProtocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exactly</a> - $7.32 Million Exploit<a href="#exactly---732-million-exploit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to exactly---732-million-exploit" title="Direct link to exactly---732-million-exploit">​</a></h3><p>Exactly Protocol, a Lending/Borrowing platform was hacked on Optimism for $7.32m.

The hack was due to a known bug in Compound V2 code.</p><p>Root cause: The exchange rate can be manipulated because of a rounding issue in the redeemFresh of CToken pool contract (The attacker strictly controls the input quantity every time they call the redeemUnderlying function.

Moments before the rug, it was found that its deployer address is directly linked to the Solfire $4.8M exit scam. </p><p>The project team manipulated the price oracle value, so he could drain all the locked funds in the market contract.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deus-dao-dei---5-million-exploit"><a href="https://twitter.com/DeusDao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deus DAO (DEI)</a> - $5 Million Exploit<a href="#deus-dao-dei---5-million-exploit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to deus-dao-dei---5-million-exploit" title="Direct link to deus-dao-dei---5-million-exploit">​</a></h3><p>On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $5 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on Arbitrum. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.</p><p>The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion:" title="Direct link to Conclusion:">​</a></h2><p>L2 blockchains offer several advantages over traditional L1 chains such as Increased Scalability, Lower Fees and Faster Transaction Times.

Several token smart contracts deployed on BSC utilize the Reflection mechanism for token holders to gain dividends, however the reflection implementation might be flawed, leading to its liquidity pool being drained by malicious actors. The third most common attack vector was Price Manipulation at 8.2%. This is common as well since poorly designed smart contracts rely on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, and hence can be easily manipulated by a large Swap trade or Flash Loan by hackers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-projects">Type of projects<a href="#type-of-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of projects" title="Direct link to Type of projects">​</a></h3><p>When comparing the types of project with the observed financial loss, a whopping 98.8% of financial loss were attributed to DeFi projects.

The funds were since bridged to multiple addresses on Tron and Ethereum. Its users reported that they could not withdraw their funds.</p><p>Fintoch advertises themselves as a blockchain financial platform built by Morgan Stanley, and users can get 1% return on investment every day. The team’s page on the Fintoch website refers &quot;Bobby Lambert&#x27;&#x27; as their CEO, when in fact he did not exist and was, in fact,  a paid actor. Earlier, the Singaporean government and Morgan Stanley both <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/global-offices/pdf/Indonesia/Indonesia_Fintoch_Important_Notice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> warnings about this “investment plan”.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ippswap---145-million-loss">ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss<a href="#ippswap---145-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 26-May-2023, a scam project, ippswap was found to have rugpulled $14.5 million USD. The ippswap project executed a concerning action by exploiting a privileged backdoor method, takeToken(), within the staking contract. This unauthorized maneuver allowed the project party to transfer IPPSwap LP Tokens, which had been staked by users, directly to their own account.  Liquidity was then subsequently removed using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT.</p><p>Some of the USDT funds flowed onto Binance exchange where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safemoon---89-million-loss">Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss<a href="#safemoon---89-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>The Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.</p><p>On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, and transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, taxing the remaining 20% as a bounty.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="swapx---73-million-loss">SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss<a href="#swapx---73-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>SwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they have not used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they have not revoked their approvals.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantis-loans---35-million-loss">Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss<a href="#atlantis-loans---35-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the core team whichresulted in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.</p><p>However, a similar proposal was submitted on June 12, and was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved the Atlantis Loans core contracts.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fut---27-million-loss">$FUT - $2.7 Million Loss<a href="#fut---27-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>Early this year on 4-Jan-2023, the $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD. The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circulate---23-million-loss">Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss<a href="#circulate---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team’s address.</p><p>Although it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract.
On the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yieldrobot---21-million-loss">YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss<a href="#yieldrobot---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss" title="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scammed users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.
Two days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.</p><p>In order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user’s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.</p><p>The new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract’s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="liango-protocol---16-million-loss">LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss<a href="#liango-protocol---16-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss" title="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.</p><p>The reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. </p><p>Based on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer’s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.</p><p>Then on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project’s back end system.</p><p>The administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. </p><p>Then the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.</p><p>Then the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deusdao-dei---13-million-loss">DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss<a href="#deusdao-dei---13-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.</p><p>The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts. However, it is undeniable that 2023 H1 has proven to be a challenging year for both investors and developers due to the continued bear market trend and exploit incidents. Below we have some final advice for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ul><li>Understand what you&#x27;re signing, do not blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)</li><li>Always double check that you are on the official website of the dApp</li><li>Be wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity</li><li>Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)</li><li>Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done</li><li>Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
If <em>High Risk</em> is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away</li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!</strong></p><p>For developers:</p><ul><li>Verify &amp; open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)</li><li>Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)</li><li>Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure</li><li>Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases</li><li>Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations</li><li>Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary</li><li>Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)</li><li>Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)</li><li>Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hashdit">Hashdit<a href="#hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hashdit" title="Direct link to Hashdit">​</a></h4><p>HashDit’s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors, helping them to make informed decisions.
