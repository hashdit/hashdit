In this article, we will analyze these types of attack incidents using several examples and finally provide some practical suggestions from a security perspective to help project teams avoid such breaches in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stakes-unanticipated-41-million-withdrawals">Stake&#x27;s Unanticipated $41 Million Withdrawals<a href="#stakes-unanticipated-41-million-withdrawals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stake&#x27;s Unanticipated $41 Million Withdrawals" title="Direct link to Stake&#x27;s Unanticipated $41 Million Withdrawals">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://stake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stake.com</a>, a crypto gambling protocol, offers a variety of casino games such as dice, blackjack, Lingo, and more. Additionally, they provide sports betting options for basketball, tennis, volleyball, and others. On September 4th, Stake.com encountered an abnormal outflow of funds, totaling approximately $41 million.</p><p>The attack transpired across multiple chains, incurring losses of around $15.7 million on ETH, $7.8 million on Polygon, and $17.8 million on BSC. This brought the cumulative losses to over $41 million.</p><p>One of the fraudulent transactions can be traced back to: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x98610e0a20b5ebb08c40e78b4d2271ae1fbd4fc3b8783b1bb7a5687918fad54e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a>.<br>
<!-- -->From the transaction details, it&#x27;s evident that the funds were transferred directly from Stake.com&#x27;s hot wallet: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x974caa59e49682cda0ad2bbe82983419a2ecc400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a> to the attacker&#x27;s address. Subsequently, the funds were dispersed among numerous accounts.</p><p>Stake confirmed this security breach via social media, stating, &quot;Three hours ago, unauthorized transactions were initiated from Stake&#x27;s ETH/BSC hot wallets.&quot; As a result of this security incident, Stake&#x27;s operations were temporarily put on hold.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-coinex-funds-62-million-dollar-loss">The CoinEx Fund&#x27;s 6.2 Million Dollar Loss<a href="#the-coinex-funds-62-million-dollar-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The CoinEx Fund&#x27;s 6.2 Million Dollar Loss" title="Direct link to The CoinEx Fund&#x27;s 6.2 Million Dollar Loss">​</a></h2><p>Stake.com isn&#x27;t the only entity that has fallen prey to a breach of hot wallet private keys. On September 12, 2023, CoinEx detected irregular withdrawals from several of its hot wallet addresses, which were utilized to store user assets.
The unauthorized transactions affected 19 chains, including $ETH, $TRON, and $MATIC, bringing the total loss to an estimated $55 million.</p><p>One particular unauthorized transaction can be seen here: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa0775ff7c49fd775f86ec961369ab99ceaeeade33334970c696dbd4b35022df3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a>.
One can observe that the assets were directly transferred from CoinEX&#x27;s hot wallet, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x53eb3ea47643e87e8f25dd997a37b3b5260e7336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a>, to the hacker&#x27;s address. This indicates that the culprits may have managed to seize control of CoinEX&#x27;s hot wallet&#x27;s private key.</p><p>Following the hacking event, CoinEx temporarily suspended crypto deposits/withdrawals, relocated assets to more secure addresses, overhauled and redeployed the wallet system, and engaged in efforts with other exchanges to freeze the attacker&#x27;s assets.</p><p>Unauthorized Transactions Drain Over $2.7M from Remitano Exchange
A mere week after CoinEx fell victim to a cyber intrusion, another exchange, Remitano, succumbed to unauthorized transactions that led to over $2.7 million being pilfered from its wallet across various chains, including #Ethereum and #TRON.</p><p>To illustrate the scenario, consider one of the unauthorized transactions on the ETH chain: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe0725362fd774de0d8416d5e3d028063508ffa61f68087c576320e42159677a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a>. </p><p>We can observe that approximately 1.3M USDT was directly shifted from Remitano&#x27;s hot wallet <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2819c144d5946404c0516b6f817a960db37d4929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet</a> to the assailant&#x27;s address <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x74530e81E9f4715c720b6b237f682CD0e298B66C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet</a>. Consequently, the perceived Remitano hack also appears to be a consequence of their hot wallet&#x27;s private key leakage. This presumably allowed the hacker to gain direct control over the hot wallet and transfer all assets.</p><p>Gratefully, Tether responded promptly and froze two addresses allegedly utilized by the assailant on both the #Ethereum and #TRON chains, potentially preserving 2.7M $USDT.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="security-recommendations-from-hashdit">Security Recommendations from HashDit<a href="#security-recommendations-from-hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security Recommendations from HashDit" title="Direct link to Security Recommendations from HashDit">​</a></h2><p>Since last September, numerous instances of hot wallet private key leaks have rattled various projects. Though Stake and CoinEx have stated that the affected funds comprise only a minor share of total assets, and users&#x27; funds are safeguarded, Twitter responses reveal growing public suspicion of insider activities at these projects, dramatically undermining user trust. These incidents underscore the significance of proactive risk management concerning project wallets and funds. HashDit, consistently carrying out related security tasks, offers the following recommendations based on our experience in averting hacking incidents:</p><ol><li><strong>Adopt Comprehensive Address Planning and Isolation Design</strong>: For high balance addresses, refrain from frequent participation in DeFi contract operations. Replenish hot wallet balances regularly in batches to minimize balance fluctuations and risk exposure.</li><li><strong>Enforce Distributed Access Rights</strong>: Avoid allotting comprehensive access rights to the hot wallet to a single entity. Utilize a multisig wallet or MPC solution to necessitate multiple approvals for transactions, bolstering security measures.</li><li><strong>Monitor Key Management</strong>: Treat the access key to hot wallets as a critical asset and protect it with a suite of physical and digital measures.

The main goal of a multisig wallet is to create redundancy by requiring multiple private key signatures to authorize a transaction, similar to other crypto wallet solutions. Smart wallets utilize a group of exclusive key pairs and wallet owners can set the minimum number of signatures required for authorizing any transaction, allowing them to distribute the keys associated with the primary wallet to other parties and decentralize the responsibility of managing funds. As a result, multiple parties must sign off on a transaction before it is validated, providing an extra layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets associated with it. This mechanism also prevents malicious actors from accessing funds if one of the accounts private keys is lost or stolen.</p><p> <!-- -->To learn more about the risks associated with traditional crypto wallets and to get a comprehensive technical analysis of the benefits of using a multisig wallet, please check out our article, <a href="https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/The-risks-and-future-of-crypto-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Risk and Future of Crypto Wallets</a>.

Additionally, we strongly advise projects with simple crypto wallets that have elevated privileges in their decentralized applications to switch to a multisig solution. If your project has any roles with elevated privileges in its smart contracts, it is essential to migrate all the wallets from classic to multisig setups. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Gnosis Safe and Trust Wallet to manage the Safe. However, before considering migrating your smart contracts to a multisig solution, ensure that your project complies with the following requirements:</p><p> <!-- -->Make sure your smart contracts have a mechanism to change the addresses with elevated roles. For instance, if your smart contract is using the Ownable interface, one might be able to use the contract function <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transferOwnership</a> to transfer the ownership between addresses - in this case from an External Owned Address (EOA) to the multisig wallet. If your contract does not have this capability to change a role address, we suggest adding such capability to a new version of your smart contract and upgrading it. Note: to upgrade one’s smart contract, one needs to use a proxy smart contract.

The most common and most effective type of attacks in the crypto industry is the usage of social engineering attacks, phishing and scams are still the most profitable ways to steal crypto assets because they are single and rapid to be put into place, one only need to build a fake website pretending to be real Web3 projects, or fake wallet application that steal the data one inadvertently shares with them. In many cases, such malicious applications request seed phrases or private keys, which should never be shared - only if one migrates their wallet’s private keys to another wallet provider. To summarize, as a user or investor, it just requires a small amount of inattention for one to click a malicious link and interact with the underlying application for them to lose part of all of their crypto assets.</p><p> <!-- -->For projects, it becomes a real problem to manage a considerable amount of crypto assets. The project is only as secure as their less secure link. Not only are they susceptible to phishing attacks, but also, to hacks and sometimes internal jobs or an employee who went rogue that could be covered as hacks.</p><p> <!-- -->Note: If one discovers, their private keys or seed phrases have been compromised, they should move any remaining assets to a new safe wallet as soon as possible!</p><p> <!-- -->This is why we consider crypto wallets a single point of failure. A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails, causes the entire system (Decentralized application or wallet) to fail. It is a critical component or a bottleneck that, if it becomes unavailable, causes the system to be unavailable as well. It is important to identify and mitigate single points of failure in order to increase the reliability and availability of a system.</p><p> <!-- -->In a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, a single point of failure can exist if the private key associated with a particular public key is lost or compromised.</p><p> <!-- -->So let’s consider the classic dilemma in the web3 ecosystem: “Not your crypto, not your coins” - the dilemma between self-custody such as hardware wallets, and third-party custody, such as in exchanges. On the one hand, one should take full ownership of managing their crypto wallets, using, storing, and securing them on their own. They would be subjected to the existing risk of losing or mismanaging them. On the other hand, some users would rather delegate the management of their crypto wallet to a third party that is specialized in the matter. This is a valid debate.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Self custody" src="/hashdit/assets/images/self_custody-f5e7d8a723de534f1465c27f62783991.png" width="1600" height="1068" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 2</i>: <u>Ledger self-custody hardware wallet.</u></div><br> It is important however for every end-user to understand the risks associated with the management of crypto wallets. But when thinking of mass adoption, there is always a community that would rather pay not to have to waste time or to worry about the risks and responsibility that it is to securely manage their crypto life savings. Such groups would rather rely on a trusted third-party entity to do it for them. Similar to what we have done over the years with banks and insurance.<p><img loading="lazy" alt="3rd party custody illustraction" src="/hashdit/assets/images/3rd_party_custody-a2445bffb53111a46149b4e2f0ba65f7.png" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 3</i>: <u>Illustration of a third-party custody safe.</u></div><br> However, in this article, we are not evaluating the many practical and philosophical pros and cons of each one of the options and are limiting ourselves to mentioning that each option implies a very different level of responsibilities and requires different levels of expertise in cybersecurity, in general. Self-custody, with today’s technology, is still risky even for individuals with technical knowledge.<p> <!-- -->But, many solutions are in place to address the single point of failure problem and enable a more secure self-custody experience for users and web3 projects. So let’s discover the solutions.</p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-secure-future-of-crypto-wallets">The Secure Future of Crypto Wallets<a href="#the-secure-future-of-crypto-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Secure Future of Crypto Wallets" title="Direct link to The Secure Future of Crypto Wallets">​</a></h2><div align="justify"><p> <!-- -->To mitigate the risks of a single point of failure in PKI, over the years organizations have created securities policies and best practices gathered in security frameworks such as the ISO/IEC 27099. In such a framework, some of the guidelines suggest the implementation of robust key management protocols in combination with HSMs, as well as regular testing and monitoring of these systems for vulnerabilities. This includes implementing measures such as backups and redundant solutions to ensure that the system remains functional in the event of a key management failure, at the software and hardware level.</p><p> <!-- -->However, the crypto space has changed the way we use public key infrastructure. Now, the new practice is to use it for managing crypto assets. And PKI&#x27;s traditional policies and procedures did not take into account the usage of such mechanisms for crypto asset management. The web3 industry had to develop solutions for this new use case of asymmetric keys being used as wallets.</p><p> <!-- -->Thanks to cryptographic techniques such as signature verification, multi-party computing (MPC), and smart contracts technology, two new solutions are being considered the future of crypto wallets because of their ease of use, flexibility, security, control, compatibility with current existing solutions while addressing the problems of a single point of failure. On the one hand, there are the Multi-party Computation Wallets and the Smart Wallets, also known as multi-signature (multisig) wallets.</p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-party-computation-wallets">Multi-Party Computation Wallets<a href="#multi-party-computation-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-Party Computation Wallets" title="Direct link to Multi-Party Computation Wallets">​</a></h3><div align="justify"> Firstly, multi-party computation (MPC) wallets are crypto asset wallets that can use MPC cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, or oblivious transfer. The goal of such solutions is to enable different parties to manage one private key and the assets associated with it, without one single participant knowing the whole private key. This means, not a single entity knows the private key on his own, which prevents them from accessing the funds.<p> <!-- -->Such particularity makes an MPC wallet a tool for creating a shared crypto account, with family members or with your business partners. MPC wallets help in introducing trust when required to manage crypto assets together.</p><p> <!-- -->MPC wallets are still in their early days, mainly because (secure) multi-party computation is still an evolving field in cryptographic and should still evolve in the next few years with great new techniques.</p><p>Here are some of the MPC <b>advantages</b>:</p><ul><li>Off-chain recovery.</li><li>Chain agnostic.</li><li>No gas overhead.</li><li>No need for change in Dapp for integration.</li></ul><p>Some of the <b>drawbacks</b> are:</p><ul><li>Early stage technology, libraries implementations, which is not great from a security point of view because they can have undetected vulnerabilities.</li><li>Immutability and lack of redundancy - once created, one cannot change the signers of the associated wallets. In case one loses their wallet, all the funds stored in the MPC will stay blocked.</li><li>All wallets associated with it have to sign. There is no m-over-n signature architecture.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-wallets">Smart Wallets<a href="#smart-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart Wallets" title="Direct link to Smart Wallets">​</a></h3><p> <!-- -->Secondly, smart (contract) wallets or multisig wallets have been used and battle-tested for longer. Indeed, they are smart contracts deployed on chains and publicly available for anyone to verify. With smart wallets, similarly to MPC wallets, it is possible for a group of individuals to manage together crypto assets associated with the main smart wallet.</p><p> <!-- -->Multisig wallet owners are able to set up the minimum number of signatures required for the wallet to validate and authorize transactions. This allows them to distribute the keys associated with the main wallet account to other parties, decentralizing the responsibility of managing the funds of a project and creating redundancy.</p><p> <!-- -->Practically speaking, to authorize a transaction multiple parties have to read and validate the transaction before it can be taken into account. Thanks to this mechanism, if one of the private keys is lost or stolen, a malicious actor will not be able to access the funds without the other wallet owners. And they are notified someone is performing a suspicious transaction that can be confirmed directly with other key managers. Such a mechanism provides an additional layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets it holds.</p><p> <!-- -->Multisig wallets are important for individual users who want to keep ownership of their crypto assets. This helps solve the problem of lost hard drives where crypto wallets or seed phrases were stored. If one gets lost, they still can manage the funds and reconfigure the multisig and remove the lost key and add a new one.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="2 of 3 Multisig Wallet" src="/hashdit/assets/images/multisig-d2f2320eb53c484cb679756e125e62cb.png" width="1458" height="736" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 4</i>: <u>2 of 3 Multi-Signature wallet.</u></div><br><p> <!-- -->Additionally, multisig wallets can provide an additional layer of security for organizations or groups such as DAO that hold large amounts of crypto assets. By requiring multiple signatures for transactions, multisig wallets can help to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the funds. One of the main actors that can benefit from multisig wallets is the web3 projects. In recent history, many hacks such as The AscenDex hack as well as the Ankr protocol hack happened because of leaked/stolen private keys. These two projects suffered major financial losses severely impacting not only the project financials but their partners and the trust placed in them by the users, investors, and the community. Multi-sig could become a new standard.</p><p> <!-- -->Multi sig has also a very interesting added value. From the perspective of web3 projects and protocols: The increasing number of smart contracts in a decentralized application and the increasing complexity of their architecture and interactions, it becomes fundamental to provide transparency and visibility on key performance indicators such as the usage of a secure crypto wallet. They fulfill two main roles: managing crypto assets, but also performing important actions in decentralized applications such as updating the smart contract, pausing a protocol, changing the fees, etc.</p><p> <!-- -->Such information is relevant not only for web3 projects&#x27; internal security and monitoring but also to increase trust between them and business partners, customers and investors. Since the blockchain is a single source of truth, all the stakeholders can easily verify the security measure on the chain,</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Observability and Monitoring" src="/hashdit/assets/images/monitoring-67cc5b802b6652daed38fdef3c7a999e.jpeg" width="1063" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 5</i>: <u>Observability and Monitoring.</u></div><br>  Smart wallets are one of the most advanced security solutions for managing crypto wallets for projects to allow anyone to certify they are using proper security measures to protect their applications and as a consequence, protect their users, their business partners, and their community.<p>Smart wallets are quite versatile, enabling more features, and here are a few of them:</p><ul><li>Timelock - prevent spending before a certain date.</li><li>Spending limits.</li><li>Mutability, add and remove keys or signers after the wallet is set up.</li><li>Gas abstractions and pay for fees with other tokens than network tokens.</li><li>Transaction batching.</li></ul><p>Some of the <b>drawbacks</b> are:</p><ul><li>The overhead for the multi-wallet creation is about 30-40.000 gas and an additional 2.000 gas on the subsequent ones.</li><li>Requires Dapp adoption of the EIP 1271 standard.</li></ul></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-on-the-security-perspective">Conclusion on the Security Perspective.<a href="#conclusion-on-the-security-perspective" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion on the Security Perspective." title="Direct link to Conclusion on the Security Perspective.">​</a></h2><div align="justify"><p> <!-- -->MPC and Smart Wallets are the future technologies for crypto wallets even if MPC and its cryptographic technologies are still being developed and standardized. Multisig, on the other hand, has been around for longer, and battle-tested and even hacked with the Parity Multisig Hack which made projects put more effort into smart wallet security. Both types of wallets create redundancy to prevent the mismanagement of funds by one user.</p><p> <!-- -->Even if MPC wallets display a simpler and off-chain process for wallet creation and recovery, being a little cheaper to use and more compatible with decentralized applications, they lack flexibility once they are created. Losing any of the keys required to sign a transaction prevents the parties from accessing the wallet&#x27;s funds. Smart wallets on the other hand are more flexible, users can be added or removed from the multisig wallet, and keys can be rotated, which is important in case of a security breach or a lost key. Finally, because they are smart contracts, they can implement very different functional features such as paying limits, lack of funds, and others.</p><p> <!-- -->We prefer Multi-signature wallets over other options such as multi-party computation wallets because the latter cannot be easily identified nor audited on-chain. Any project user, business partner, or investor can verify on the chain they are using security best practices to reduce the risks associated with a compromised private key be it an internal job or an external hack, it just makes the whole system more redundant and resilient.</p></div></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/smart-contract-security">smart-contract-security</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/standards">standards</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/best-practices">best practices</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/crypto-wallets">crypto wallets</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/smart-wallets">smart wallets</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/mpc">mpc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/multisig">multisig</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/multi-signature">multi-signature</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Introduction</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/docs/intro">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/docs/hashdit-api/api-access">API Documentations</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/hashdit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Hashdit Inc.
