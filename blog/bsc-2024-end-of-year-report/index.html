Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.</p><p>Furthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true “exploited amount” of the incident.

These scams often operate under a &quot;Scam-as-a-Service&quot; model, allowing individuals to purchase malicious scripts to conduct their own scam campaigns. The primary method involves tricking users into visiting phishing websites and signing scam transactions with their crypto wallets, leading to the theft of their funds. This technique is not limited to a single blockchain but follows the flow of money across various chains. In 2024, Wallet Drainers continue to run wild, spreading havoc across ordinary users who are not careful in the space. Some of the notable instances include:</p><ul><li>Wallet Drainers have extended their reach beyond EVM chains to include networks like TON and Cardano.</li><li>Scammers continue to focus on high-profile events, such as the Pudgy’s PENGU airdrop, to maximize their impact.</li><li>Compromised data from breaches like MailerLite and LastPass have been used to spread phishing scams.</li><li>Drainers have created fake channels and social media accounts on platforms like Telegram and Discord to mislead users.</li><li>Scammers have developed fake meeting software and used social engineering to trick users into downloading malware.</li><li>Targeting commonly used npm packages in crypto projects, such as Solana/Web3.js and LottieFiles, to compromise multiple projects&#x27; front ends.</li><li>DNS hijacking incidents, including the major compromise of Squarespace, resulted in significant impacts on many hosted sites, such as Compound and Celer.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continued-rise-of-dprk-scams">Continued rise of DPRK Scams<a href="#continued-rise-of-dprk-scams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continued rise of DPRK Scams" title="Direct link to Continued rise of DPRK Scams">​</a></h3><p>DPRK-affiliated personnel continue to target trending protocols and high-net-worth individuals in the Web3 space. Their tactics include impersonating legitimate employees to compromise projects, exfiltrate sensitive data, and steal funds over time. Notable incidents include the compromises of DMM Bitcoin and WazirX exchanges. Additionally, they exploit non-technical vulnerabilities to compromise large Total Value Locked (TVL) Web3 methods.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continued-rise-of-spoofing-scams">Continued rise of Spoofing Scams<a href="#continued-rise-of-spoofing-scams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continued rise of Spoofing Scams" title="Direct link to Continued rise of Spoofing Scams">​</a></h3><p>Scammers have adopted a new tactic of sending small amounts of real money to unsuspecting victims. This involves creating addresses with similar endings to those that users normally interact with and sending a few pennies. They monitor the mempool and quickly generate these addresses to follow up on original transactions.
