In contrast, in 2022, this value dropped to just $3.7m - even when there were several considerable events that represent almost half of the stolen funds. This shows that the number of security exploits with high financial impact is decreasing. Such decrease could be explained by the fact that projects with important funds are better secured and are more battle-tested. As such, malicious actors seem to be focusing their efforts on projects with more modest funds, concluding in lesser value exploits.</p><p>This pie chart shows a better understanding of the financial losses over the year with 2022 accounting for 57.84% of the total financial loss across, 2021 being 42.10% and 2020 with a mere 0.07%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-5" src="/hashdit/assets/images/financial_loss_annual-a3d9b71988d9d3611588f66bec19d3fb.png" width="1528" height="925" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 5: Financial losses in % over the last 3 years</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-attack-vectors">Type of attack vectors<a href="#type-of-attack-vectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of attack vectors" title="Direct link to Type of attack vectors">​</a></h4><p>According to our statistics, this is the breakdown of the general attack vectors from 2020 - 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-6" src="/hashdit/assets/images/general_attack_type-06c8c7e1079f1a0734619b4e8c3d4779.png" width="1528" height="729" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 6: Number of incidents per attack vector over the last 3 years</p><p>It can be seen that crypto scams (in green) are a growing concern on the BSC, with 167 in 2022, a 328% increase YoY.

Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn’t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="qubitfinance---80-million-loss">QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss<a href="#qubitfinance---80-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss" title="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.</p><p>Root cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).</p><p>The legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evodefi---50-million-loss">EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss<a href="#evodefi---50-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss" title="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>The team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) &amp; Polygon, invested users’ funds on Terra’s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.</p><p>However, due to the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.</p><p>Thus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users’ funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund’s value.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablefund---23-million-loss">StableFund - $23 Million Loss<a href="#stablefund---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss" title="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>StableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.</p><p>In reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.</p><p>The project started from 2022-06-27, where &gt;13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elephant-money---22-million-loss">Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss<a href="#elephant-money---22-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.</p><p>The root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transit-finance---21-million-loss">Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss<a href="#transit-finance---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for &gt; $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.</p><p>Thankfully, &gt; $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).</p><p>The root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ankr--helio---20-million-loss">ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss<a href="#ankr--helio---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for &gt; $15m, bringing the total damage to &gt; $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.</p><p>Helio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform’s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss">Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss<a href="#racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.</p><p>For Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.</p><p>For the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flare---17-million-loss">$FLARE - $17 Million Loss<a href="#flare---17-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the &quot;balance&quot; related data structure.</p><p>The project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this “balance” related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.</p><p>However, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss">DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss<a href="#dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m. The hacker compromised multiple private keys of the team. As a result, the hacker removed liquidity from the projects and stole all funds from their hot wallets. The funds have already been bridged to ETH chain and deposited into Tornado Cash.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h3><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transactions.
