the <strong>Ponzi scheme</strong> is a form of fraud that lures new investors and
pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.
As you can imagine, if recent investors pay to earlier investors
then... who pays the recent investors? The answer is, the even more
recent investors. And if there are no more recent investors, then the
latest ones remain with a loss, and the scheme collapses.</p><p>The ponzi scheme is often referred to as pyramid scheme,
because to pay the &quot;higher floor&quot; investors with a profit, a
larger, &quot;lower floor&quot; has to be created, like in the picture below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image1-fe6d23e0bfb5bc0141ee3387369b91ff.jpg" width="880" height="556" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em><a href="https://sperrinlaw.net/financial-crime-fraud/ponzi-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sperrinlaw.net/financial-crime-fraud/ponzi-fraud/</a></em></p><p>Since the pyramid is not a real business, in terms of creating a
product or a service and leveraging it to earn money on the market, in
order to keep the funds flowing in, new investors have to be recruited
and their &quot;investment&quot; is used to pay the old investors, who can then
report significant returns on their investments. This creates an
illusion of a profitable business, at least as long, as the current
&quot;lowest floor&quot; manages to recruit new members.</p><p>If that&#x27;s so obvious, then why people keep falling for it? Usually, the
ponzi schemes are disguised as legitimate investments or projects. They
will do everything to hide it&#x27;s true nature so the new coming investors
will believe they just met an investment of their lifetime. And when the
scheme falls, it&#x27;s already too late to run away.</p><p>Are there ponzi schemes in web3? If so, how to spot them? How not to
lose money? Read on to learn more!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ponzi-schemes-in-web3">Ponzi schemes in Web3<a href="#ponzi-schemes-in-web3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ponzi schemes in Web3" title="Direct link to Ponzi schemes in Web3">​</a></h3><p>Although Ponzi schemes originated in the traditional financial world,
with the development of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), these fraudulent
business models have also started to emerge in Web3.
Web3 Ponzi schemes take advantage of the following features of DeFi,
attracting investors through high returns and incentives.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Anonymity:</strong> The decentralized nature of DeFi allows Ponzi scheme
operators to remain anonymous, making it difficult to trace and hold
them accountable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Utilizing smart contracts:</strong> A smart contract is a self-executing,
self-enforcing protocol governed by its explicit terms and conditions.
It stores and carries out contractual clauses via blockchain. These
schemes use smart contracts to automate their operations, making them
harder to detect while promising high returns on investments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Some Ponzi schemes create their own tokens and use
them for fundraising. They offer high rewards in the form of tokens,
which may have little to no real value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited regulation:</strong> The DeFi space has limited regulation,
making it easier for Ponzi schemes to operate without being detected or
shut down by financial authorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low cost:</strong> Ponzi scheme projects can be fully autonomous and
deployed at lower costs. They can even be continuously cloned.</p></li></ol><p><strong>So, how can one identify if a Web3 DeFi project is a Ponzi scheme or
not?</strong></p><p>Firstly, let&#x27;s look at the project characteristics. Ponzi schemes
usually have the following features:</p><ol><li><p>Typical Web3 Ponzi schemes often employ <strong>aggressive marketing</strong>
tactics, promising <strong>high and fixed short-term returns</strong>. For example,
the official websites of such projects usually contain descriptions like
&quot;<strong>fixed daily profit</strong>&quot;. However, we know that fixed daily returns
are unrealistic, and this is one of the biggest flaws in Ponzi schemes.
In the cases we&#x27;ve accumulated, some Ponzi projects have even promised
<strong>25% daily</strong> interest rates!</p></li><li><p><strong>High Referral Incentives</strong>: Ponzi schemes often combine with
pyramid scheme marketing, aiming to attract more new investors and
subsequent investment funds. Therefore, they often advertise a referral
reward system on their official websites, sometimes even with
multi-level referral rewards. Typical pyramid scheme descriptions
include terms like &quot;tiered referral rewards.&quot;
The two images below are tiered referral reward system diagrams taken
from Ponzi scheme websites:</p><p> <img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image2-45c5a553874a557c129010d690d8e0df.jpg" width="936" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p><p> <img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image3-3ac3ef15ca73e1c54f65254b5e5d9aea.jpg" width="936" height="392" class="img_ev3q"></p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>These schemes usually disguise themselves as <strong>staking or mining</strong>
projects to attract investors&#x27; principal investments and recruit new
participants. However, in fact, they generally do not offer any real
products or services but just <strong>promise an ability to make money</strong>. They
often incorporate some popular trends, for example, AI or ChatGPT,
promoting their projects as groundbreaking and innovative, as they need
to attract more people and <strong>maintain an appearance of legitimacy</strong>.</li></ol><p>Below are some additional features that can help investors determine
whether a project is a Ponzi scheme. Please note that these traits are
not exclusive to Ponzi scheme projects. Generally, the more of these a
project has, the higher the risk:</p><ol><li><p>No proper investments: The project appears to have no investments
or partnerships, which means that the project lacks any business
endorsements.</p></li><li><p>Opaque team information: The team behind the project remains
anonymous to the public, making it easier for such projects to
engage in malicious activities with lower costs.</p></li><li><p>Lack of documentation: There is a lack of documentation and
whitepapers, as the project does not provide details about its
internal operations and how it achieves these high returns. This is
a potential red flag.</p></li><li><p>No external audit report: Projects with audit reports generally
have a relatively smaller chance of encountering security issues.
However, please note that having an audit report does not guarantee
absolute security, as the audit report may only cover certain
contracts and not examine the entire economic ecosystem of the
project. The reliability of the audit report is also important,
depending on the issuer and quality; well-known and reputable audit
companies usually have greater credibility.</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decrypting-a-ponzi-project-smart-contract">Decrypting a Ponzi project smart contract<a href="#decrypting-a-ponzi-project-smart-contract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Decrypting a Ponzi project smart contract" title="Direct link to Decrypting a Ponzi project smart contract">​</a></h3><p>Are you a more tech-savvy user? That&#x27;s great. If you have some
familiarity with Solidity code or want to learn it, we encourage you to
go through the code snippets below to understand some of the
characteristics of Ponzi scheme smart contracts.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, Ponzi scheme Web3 projects generally don&#x27;t
have any real products, and therefore don&#x27;t require many smart
contracts. In their entire project ecosystem, there are usually only a
few investment contracts that directly interact with users. At most,
there might be an additional token contract, with the token often
serving as a staking reward. However, this token typically won&#x27;t be
created on any decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning that holders of
this token cannot swap it for other valuable tokens or
stablecoins.</p><p>Next, we will delve into the characteristics of Ponzi investment smart
contracts by using some code snippets as examples.</p><ol><li><p><strong>There is no method in the contract to withdraw the initial
investment; it only allows for receiving dividends based on time</strong></p><p>   For example, in the below withdraw function, users cannot withdraw
their principal investment; they can only withdraw dividends along
with potential referral earnings.</p><p>This is also the difference between Ponzi schemes and regular
mining/staking contracts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image4-5419d40c280f12e959ae01d4140c36df.jpg" width="936" height="706" class="img_ev3q"></p></li><li><p><strong>Dividends are calculated based on a fixed daily returns ROI and
time.</strong>
For example, in the getUserDividends function below, the user&#x27;s
dividend is calculated by multiplying the fixed daily return rate
for the user&#x27;s deposit plan by the time elapsed. Typically, the
daily return ROI is a hard-coded value or constant.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image5-0be09885b718704e2b3c4fa2eb8e394e.jpg" width="936" height="334" class="img_ev3q"></p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>The code contains logic related to a Referral system.</strong>
As we mentioned earlier, Ponzi investment smart contracts usually
include a referral system, providing users with additional
incentives for bringing new users into the scheme.</p><p>   For example, in the contract below, there is a tiered referral
reward mechanism, with first, second, and third-level referrers
receiving referral rewards at a ratio of 9:2:1.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image6-89dc3e9f6b73eb957d0e5a648979c032.jpg" width="936" height="216" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Of course, the referral rewards come from the principal investment of
later investors. As can be seen, the invest function in the code
distributes part of the user&#x27;s investment amount to all referrers at
their respective levels.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image7-08711fb5c3041705de3ed218b9c4f963.jpg" width="936" height="1004" class="img_ev3q"></p></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>The project party generates revenue by charging tax fees on
users&#x27; deposits.</strong>
For example, in the code below, the project party charges a 5% dev
fee on the user&#x27;s principal, so they can profit as long as there
are new users, regardless of how much money remains in the
pool.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image8-f798c99acc5a52c33dbcac586e63dd42.jpg" width="936" height="224" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image9-d4714379c78ef3c5a7c8cd71883bc6ba.jpg" width="936" height="150" class="img_ev3q"></p></li></ol><p> However, sometimes the project party does not directly impose a tax
fee, claiming to have a 0% tax fee. In reality, the project party can
become the initial referrer and continuously profit through the
referral mechanism. This method of profiting is just more
concealed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="go-further-a-complete-ponzi-example-for-more-tech-savvy-users"><strong>Go further: A complete Ponzi example for more tech-savvy users</strong><a href="#go-further-a-complete-ponzi-example-for-more-tech-savvy-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to go-further-a-complete-ponzi-example-for-more-tech-savvy-users" title="Direct link to go-further-a-complete-ponzi-example-for-more-tech-savvy-users">​</a></h3><p>Let&#x27;s go further! we created a sample ponzi scheme code based on what

<em>recruitAndInvest()</em> function. Here, a new investor specifies a
referral address (the person who introduced them to the scheme) and
sends 0.1 ether as their investment. </p></li><li><p><strong>Incentive to Recruit:</strong> The incentive to recruit new members is
twofold: Frist, the referrer gets a count increase in their recruits
mapping, which will later increase their ROI. Second, the new
investor gets a bonus of 0.1 ether added to their investment,
effectively doubling their initial investment. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ponzi Mechanics:</strong> The Ponzi nature of the scheme is visible in
the <em>calculateTotalReturn</em> function. The ROI is determined by the
number of recruits: 5-9 recruits: 25% ROI 10 or more recruits: 50%
ROI The more people an investor recruits, the higher their promised
return. </p></li><li><p><strong>Potential Collapse:</strong> The scheme can collapse at some point. The
ability to withdraw funds is implemented in the <em>cashOut()</em>
function. If the contract doesn&#x27;t have enough funds to pay out the
total return (initial investment + profit), the cash out will fail.
This will happen if not enough new investors are coming in to fund
the returns for earlier investors. The
<em>require(address(this).balance &gt;= totalReturn, &quot;Insufficient funds
in the contract&quot;);</em> line checks for this. </p></li><li><p><strong>Safety Net (or Illusion of One):</strong> If an investor hasn&#x27;t
recruited at least 5 people, they can only withdraw their initial
investment after 90 days. This might give the illusion of safety and
legitimacy, but it&#x27;s just a delay tactic. During the 90 days, the
scheme might already rise and fall, and when the time for withdrawal
comes, there might already be no funds on the contract.</p></li></ul><p>Now you have a deeper understanding of the contract code for Ponzi
schemes. However, in reality, some Ponzi smart contracts are even
closed-source, making them opaque and more difficult to analyze and
understand, thereby concealing the contract&#x27;s logic and risks from
users. When dealing with closed-source contracts, we should maintain an
even higher level of vigilance and examine both the project and contract
levels comprehensively to determine if they exhibit characteristics of a
Ponzi scheme.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="identifying-ponzi-schemes-in-a-more-simple-way">Identifying Ponzi schemes in a more simple way<a href="#identifying-ponzi-schemes-in-a-more-simple-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Identifying Ponzi schemes in a more simple way" title="Direct link to Identifying Ponzi schemes in a more simple way">​</a></h3><p>In summary, before investing in Web3 DeFi projects, you need to conduct
thorough due diligence to avoid mistakenly entering Ponzi schemes and
incurring losses.</p><p>At the project level, conduct comprehensive research on the project
team, token economy, and underlying technology. Be cautious of
unrealistic high return promises, ensure that there is adequate
transparency in the project, and verify that the project has a sound
governance mechanism.</p><p>At the smart contract level, fully understand the source code and
determine if there are any red flags in the code, always assessing risks
before gaining a deeper understanding.</p><p>However, is this too complicated and difficult? After all, not all
investors are technical experts. Don&#x27;t worry, HashDit can help
you.</p><p>For smart contracts, you can scan whether it is a Ponzi contract

The white-hat <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hashflow-users-made-whole-after-600k-exploit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hack</a> is related to a Hashflow project, where an old contract had an Open Approval, this means that any users that have approved funds to the victim contract can have his existing funds stolen.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/Proportion_Exploit_Type-11228b3ddf1c7a3f24c69d20bc6a16b4.png" width="2882" height="848" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 5: Proportion of different type of exploits</p><p>However, it is interesting to note that even when the number of hacks are nearly doubled to that of scams, the financial impact of hacks were less significant than the ones related to the scams.

You can refer to our previous [report]((https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/bsc-2022-end-of-year-report/)) for more information.<p>The observed trend potentially signifies an escalating presence of scammers within the crypto space.

Several token smart contracts deployed on BSC utilize the Reflection mechanism for token holders to gain dividends, however the reflection implementation might be flawed, leading to its liquidity pool being drained by malicious actors. The third most common attack vector was Price Manipulation at 8.2%. This is common as well since poorly designed smart contracts rely on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, and hence can be easily manipulated by a large Swap trade or Flash Loan by hackers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-projects">Type of projects<a href="#type-of-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of projects" title="Direct link to Type of projects">​</a></h3><p>When comparing the types of project with the observed financial loss, a whopping 98.8% of financial loss were attributed to DeFi projects.

The funds were since bridged to multiple addresses on Tron and Ethereum. Its users reported that they could not withdraw their funds.</p><p>Fintoch advertises themselves as a blockchain financial platform built by Morgan Stanley, and users can get 1% return on investment every day. The team’s page on the Fintoch website refers &quot;Bobby Lambert&#x27;&#x27; as their CEO, when in fact he did not exist and was, in fact,  a paid actor. Earlier, the Singaporean government and Morgan Stanley both <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/global-offices/pdf/Indonesia/Indonesia_Fintoch_Important_Notice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> warnings about this “investment plan”.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ippswap---145-million-loss">ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss<a href="#ippswap---145-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 26-May-2023, a scam project, ippswap was found to have rugpulled $14.5 million USD. The ippswap project executed a concerning action by exploiting a privileged backdoor method, takeToken(), within the staking contract. This unauthorized maneuver allowed the project party to transfer IPPSwap LP Tokens, which had been staked by users, directly to their own account.  Liquidity was then subsequently removed using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT.</p><p>Some of the USDT funds flowed onto Binance exchange where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safemoon---89-million-loss">Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss<a href="#safemoon---89-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>The Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.</p><p>On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, and transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, taxing the remaining 20% as a bounty.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="swapx---73-million-loss">SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss<a href="#swapx---73-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>SwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they have not used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they have not revoked their approvals.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantis-loans---35-million-loss">Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss<a href="#atlantis-loans---35-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the core team whichresulted in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.</p><p>However, a similar proposal was submitted on June 12, and was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved the Atlantis Loans core contracts.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fut---27-million-loss">$FUT - $2.7 Million Loss<a href="#fut---27-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>Early this year on 4-Jan-2023, the $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD. The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circulate---23-million-loss">Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss<a href="#circulate---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team’s address.</p><p>Although it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract.
On the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yieldrobot---21-million-loss">YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss<a href="#yieldrobot---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss" title="Direct link to YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scammed users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.
Two days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.</p><p>In order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user’s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.</p><p>The new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract’s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="liango-protocol---16-million-loss">LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss<a href="#liango-protocol---16-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss" title="Direct link to LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.</p><p>The reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. </p><p>Based on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer’s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.</p><p>Then on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project’s back end system.</p><p>The administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. </p><p>Then the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.</p><p>Then the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deusdao-dei---13-million-loss">DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss<a href="#deusdao-dei---13-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss">​</a></h4><p>On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.</p><p>The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts.

If the computational power of the blockchain virtual machine were to be massively improved, it&#x27;s believed that a huge evolution would come. This is where interesting cryptography schemes like &quot;interactive proof&quot; and &quot;zero knowledge proof&quot; come into play. They could significantly contribute to improving the computational power of the blockchain virtual machine and pave the way for even more exciting applications in the future.</p><p>In addition to ensuring the integrity of data, the consensus mechanism in blockchain does not provide any confidentiality guarantees by default. However, by using advanced cryptography techniques, such as zero knowledge proofs, confidentiality can be achieved on the blockchain virtual machine. Zero knowledge proof is an essential cryptographic tool that can help protect sensitive information on the blockchain, ensuring that only authorized parties have access to it. With zero knowledge proofs, the confidentiality of data is maintained, while still preserving the transparency and security of the blockchain network.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interactive-proof-vs-zero-knowledge-proof">Interactive Proof vs Zero knowledge Proof<a href="#interactive-proof-vs-zero-knowledge-proof" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interactive Proof vs Zero knowledge Proof" title="Direct link to Interactive Proof vs Zero knowledge Proof">​</a></h2><p>In the exciting and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, you might come across the abbreviation &quot;ZK&quot;. Typically, this refers to &quot;zero knowledge&quot;, which is often associated with something called &quot;zero knowledge proofs&quot;. However, it&#x27;s important to note that in some cases, &quot;ZK&quot; might actually stand for &quot;interactive proofs&quot;. This can be confusing for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with the difference between the two.</p><p>To provide a concrete illustration of the concept, consider the following scenario: Imagine that you make a claim to your friend that you possess the ability to differentiate the two faces of any coin. To put your assertion to the test, your friend hands you a random coin and asks you to demonstrate your ability by describing how you differentiate the two faces. After several rounds of this exercise, your friend becomes convinced that you possess the ability to distinguish the two sides of a coin.</p><p>In this example, your friend serves as the verifier, seeking to determine whether your claim of coin differentiation is genuine. You, on the other hand, act as the prover, seeking to convince your friend of your ability without revealing the details of your method. This scenario resembles an interactive proof, in which the verifier challenges the prover to demonstrate their knowledge, and the prover responds with evidence that satisfies the verifier&#x27;s demands.</p><p>On the other hand, zero knowledge proofs are a little different. This time you do not want to reveal how you differentiate the two faces. In this case, you and your friend both know the initial state of the coin, and you turn away while your friend decides whether to flip the coin or leave it in its current state. When you turn back, your friend asks you whether or not the coin has been flipped. If you can consistently answer correctly, your friend becomes convinced of your ability to differentiate the two faces of the coin.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/IP-b11580e6df4f828a5031c029b8a884e0.png" width="552" height="345" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/ZKP-bbe543c78f63163e0f900c7ce7790170.png" width="552" height="487" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr><tr><td>Interactive Proof</td><td>Zero Knowledge Proof</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So, the next time you see &quot;ZK&quot; in the world of cryptocurrency, remember that it might refer to either zero knowledge proofs or interactive proofs. While they&#x27;re both important concepts in cryptography, they&#x27;re not quite the same thing!</p><p>Another commonly seen fascinating term is <strong>SNARK</strong> (Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge), which can be broadly understood as those zero knowledge proofs with cheap communication and computational cost for the verifier. Do you know what &quot;zk-SNARK&quot; means? Yes, you are right - it refers to SNARK with zero knowledge properties. For further elaboration, the zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) protocol embodies the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>Zero-Knowledge: The proof does not reveal any information about the knowledge itself.</li><li>Non-interactive: The proof can be conveyed in a single message from the prover to the verifier, eliminating the need for back-and-forth interaction.</li><li>Argument: The interaction between the prover and verifier is limited, consisting of only a few rounds and minimal communication cost.</li><li>Knowledge: The proof demonstrates that the prover possesses certain knowledge or information, without revealing the information itself.</li></ul><p>Together, these features make zk-SNARKs a powerful tool for verifying the authenticity and validity of claims, while preserving the privacy and security of sensitive information. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interactive-proofsnark-in-blockchain">Interactive Proof/SNARK in Blockchain<a href="#interactive-proofsnark-in-blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interactive Proof/SNARK in Blockchain" title="Direct link to Interactive Proof/SNARK in Blockchain">​</a></h2><p>Smart contracts provide a trusted computing solution where they execute exactly as programmed, and the results cannot be tampered with by any party. However, this process can be slow and costly in some cases. In such situations, it may be more efficient to verify answers rather than computing/searching by themselves. Interactive proof can be used in the blockchain virtual machine to achieve faster computation and reduce costs. The smart contract includes a trusted verification function for incoming advice, and untrusted machines prove the validity of the computation to the verifier on-chain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-snark-improves-scalability">1. SNARK improves scalability<a href="#1-snark-improves-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. SNARK improves scalability" title="Direct link to 1. SNARK improves scalability">​</a></h3><p>Blockchain technology has been gaining a lot of attention due to its decentralized and immutable nature. However, one of the major challenges of blockchain is scalability. As more users join the network and more transactions are added, the processing time and costs increase exponentially. This can lead to a slow and expensive network, which is not practical for mass adoption.</p><p>SNARK helps reduce the transaction size by compressing the amount of data required for verification. In a traditional blockchain system, each transaction is accompanied by a set of data, including the public key of the sender, the signature, and the hash value. This data is required to verify the validity of the transaction.</p><p>However, with SNARK, the transaction data can be compressed into a shorter proof. The proof is then used to verify the transaction, instead of the full data set. This makes the transaction much smaller in size, as only the proof needs to be stored on the blockchain.</p><p>By reducing the transaction size, SNARK helps improve the scalability of blockchain. As more transactions can be processed in a shorter amount of time, the overall speed and efficiency of the network is improved.</p><p>Moreover, smaller transactions also mean lower transaction fees, making the network more accessible to a wider range of users. This can further drive adoption and increase the value of the blockchain network.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-snark-on-layer2-blockchain">2.

SNARK on Layer2 blockchain">​</a></h3><p>Layer 2 solutions are a popular approach for scaling blockchain technology. These solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and are designed to improve the speed and efficiency of transactions. One such solution is the use of sidechains or state channels. However, to ensure the security and privacy of the underlying data, these solutions require a robust proof system. SNARK is one such technology that can help to achieve this goal.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hashdit/assets/images/layer2-f0579fb7d56083c11c2d0952fd05d05b.png" width="700" height="394" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In a sidechain implementation, SNARK technology generates proofs that validate transactions on the sidechain, without revealing the underlying data. These proofs are then sent back to the main blockchain to ensure the transactions are accurate and valid. This approach helps to reduce the load on the main blockchain, allowing for a greater number of transactions to be processed.</p><p>Similarly, in state channel implementations, SNARK can be used to create a trustless channel between two parties. This enables them to conduct multiple transactions off-chain, reducing the number of transactions that need to be processed on the main blockchain. The channel is secured by a deposit held on the main blockchain, and SNARK is used to generate proofs of the transactions, which can be verified by the main blockchain at any time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zkpzk-snark-in-blockchain">ZKP/zk-SNARK in Blockchain<a href="#zkpzk-snark-in-blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ZKP/zk-SNARK in Blockchain" title="Direct link to ZKP/zk-SNARK in Blockchain">​</a></h2><p>ZKP plays a crucial role in enhancing the privacy and security of blockchain networks and many contributors on this new field to enhance the privacy of Web3.0 with ZKP.
In overview here are some ways ZKP is used in blockchain:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-identity-verification">1. Identity Verification<a href="#1-identity-verification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Identity Verification" title="Direct link to 1. Identity Verification">​</a></h3><p>In a blockchain network, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) can be used to confirm a user&#x27;s identity without disclosing any personal information. This is especially valuable in decentralized systems, where anonymity is essential.</p><p>Consider this scenario: Alice needs to prove that she is over 18 years old to a third party, but she doesn&#x27;t want to reveal her actual age or any other sensitive information. Typically, Alice would have to show some form of identification that includes her age and potentially other personal details. However, with ZKPs, Alice can demonstrate her age without compromising her privacy.</p><p>Here&#x27;s how it works: Alice creates a unique digital identity on the blockchain network and generates a ZKP that verifies she is over 18 without revealing her exact age. Alice and the third party engage in a series of interactive computations that demonstrate her age is greater than 18. The third party can then verify the accuracy of the proof without learning Alice&#x27;s actual age or any other personal information.</p><p>This approach to identity verification is highly relevant in industries such as finance, healthcare, and voting where privacy and security are crucial. By using ZKPs, individuals can safeguard their personal information while still proving their identity to third parties.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-zero-knowledge-transaction-verification">2. Zero Knowledge Transaction Verification<a href="#2-zero-knowledge-transaction-verification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Zero Knowledge Transaction Verification" title="Direct link to 2. Zero Knowledge Transaction Verification">​</a></h3><p>ZKP can also be used to verify the validity of a transaction without revealing any sensitive information about the transaction. This is particularly useful in financial transactions, where privacy is a top concern. ZKP can be used to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing the amount or the parties involved. Recall that zero knowledge proof is interactive proof with zero knowledge properties, it&#x27;s the in the same manner as the interactive proof for transaction verification but with confidentiality guaranteed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-verifiable-random-function">3. Verifiable Random Function<a href="#3-verifiable-random-function" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Verifiable Random Function" title="Direct link to 3. Verifiable Random Function">​</a></h3><p>Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) are cryptographic functions that produce random outputs while providing a proof that the output is truly random. ZKP can be used to create a VRF that provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent system, ideal for various cryptographic applications.</p><p>The VRF is generated using a secret key and a seed value. The ZKP generates a short proof that the VRF output is based on the seed and the secret key, without revealing any information about either value. This proof can then be used to verify the randomness of the VRF output, without requiring the verification party to know the secret key or the seed value.</p><p>The use of ZKP in VRF ensures that the output is random, non-predictable, and fair, making it an ideal solution for various use cases, including blockchain-based systems, where fairness and security are essential.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In conclusion, ZKP is a powerful tool for enhancing the privacy and security of blockchain networks. It enables blockchain networks to verify identities, transactions, and smart contracts without revealing any sensitive information. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, ZKP is expected to play an increasingly important role in ensuring the privacy and security of these networks.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/zero-knowledge">zero-knowledge</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/hashdit/blog/smart-wallet-migration-guide">Multisig Wallet Migration Guide</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-01-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 7, 2023</time> · <!-- -->10 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Himura K.</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">SCS@HashDit</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-contract-wallets-the-future-of-crypto-wallets">Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?<a href="#smart-contract-wallets-the-future-of-crypto-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?" title="Direct link to Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?">​</a></h2><div align="justify"><p> <!-- -->Multi-signature wallets, also referred to as multisig wallets, are standardized smart contracts that consolidate multiple accounts and private keys into a single wallet for managing crypto assets. The main goal of a multisig wallet is to create redundancy by requiring multiple private key signatures to authorize a transaction, similar to other crypto wallet solutions. Smart wallets utilize a group of exclusive key pairs and wallet owners can set the minimum number of signatures required for authorizing any transaction, allowing them to distribute the keys associated with the primary wallet to other parties and decentralize the responsibility of managing funds. As a result, multiple parties must sign off on a transaction before it is validated, providing an extra layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets associated with it. This mechanism also prevents malicious actors from accessing funds if one of the accounts private keys is lost or stolen.</p><p> <!-- -->To learn more about the risks associated with traditional crypto wallets and to get a comprehensive technical analysis of the benefits of using a multisig wallet, please check out our article, <a href="https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/The-risks-and-future-of-crypto-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Risk and Future of Crypto Wallets</a>.

Additionally, we strongly advise projects with simple crypto wallets that have elevated privileges in their decentralized applications to switch to a multisig solution. If your project has any roles with elevated privileges in its smart contracts, it is essential to migrate all the wallets from classic to multisig setups. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Gnosis Safe and Trust Wallet to manage the Safe. However, before considering migrating your smart contracts to a multisig solution, ensure that your project complies with the following requirements:</p><p> <!-- -->Make sure your smart contracts have a mechanism to change the addresses with elevated roles. For instance, if your smart contract is using the Ownable interface, one might be able to use the contract function <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transferOwnership</a> to transfer the ownership between addresses - in this case from an External Owned Address (EOA) to the multisig wallet. If your contract does not have this capability to change a role address, we suggest adding such capability to a new version of your smart contract and upgrading it. Note: to upgrade one’s smart contract, one needs to use a proxy smart contract.

The most common and most effective type of attacks in the crypto industry is the usage of social engineering attacks, phishing and scams are still the most profitable ways to steal crypto assets because they are single and rapid to be put into place, one only need to build a fake website pretending to be real Web3 projects, or fake wallet application that steal the data one inadvertently shares with them. In many cases, such malicious applications request seed phrases or private keys, which should never be shared - only if one migrates their wallet’s private keys to another wallet provider. To summarize, as a user or investor, it just requires a small amount of inattention for one to click a malicious link and interact with the underlying application for them to lose part of all of their crypto assets.</p><p> <!-- -->For projects, it becomes a real problem to manage a considerable amount of crypto assets. The project is only as secure as their less secure link.

A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails, causes the entire system (Decentralized application or wallet) to fail. It is a critical component or a bottleneck that, if it becomes unavailable, causes the system to be unavailable as well. It is important to identify and mitigate single points of failure in order to increase the reliability and availability of a system.</p><p> <!-- -->In a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, a single point of failure can exist if the private key associated with a particular public key is lost or compromised.</p><p> <!-- -->So let’s consider the classic dilemma in the web3 ecosystem: “Not your crypto, not your coins” - the dilemma between self-custody such as hardware wallets, and third-party custody, such as in exchanges. On the one hand, one should take full ownership of managing their crypto wallets, using, storing, and securing them on their own. They would be subjected to the existing risk of losing or mismanaging them. On the other hand, some users would rather delegate the management of their crypto wallet to a third party that is specialized in the matter. This is a valid debate.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Self custody" src="/hashdit/assets/images/self_custody-f5e7d8a723de534f1465c27f62783991.png" width="1600" height="1068" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 2</i>: <u>Ledger self-custody hardware wallet.</u></div><br> It is important however for every end-user to understand the risks associated with the management of crypto wallets. But when thinking of mass adoption, there is always a community that would rather pay not to have to waste time or to worry about the risks and responsibility that it is to securely manage their crypto life savings. Such groups would rather rely on a trusted third-party entity to do it for them. Similar to what we have done over the years with banks and insurance.<p><img loading="lazy" alt="3rd party custody illustraction" src="/hashdit/assets/images/3rd_party_custody-a2445bffb53111a46149b4e2f0ba65f7.png" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 3</i>: <u>Illustration of a third-party custody safe.</u></div><br> However, in this article, we are not evaluating the many practical and philosophical pros and cons of each one of the options and are limiting ourselves to mentioning that each option implies a very different level of responsibilities and requires different levels of expertise in cybersecurity, in general. Self-custody, with today’s technology, is still risky even for individuals with technical knowledge.<p> <!-- -->But, many solutions are in place to address the single point of failure problem and enable a more secure self-custody experience for users and web3 projects.

In such a framework, some of the guidelines suggest the implementation of robust key management protocols in combination with HSMs, as well as regular testing and monitoring of these systems for vulnerabilities. This includes implementing measures such as backups and redundant solutions to ensure that the system remains functional in the event of a key management failure, at the software and hardware level.</p><p> <!-- -->However, the crypto space has changed the way we use public key infrastructure. Now, the new practice is to use it for managing crypto assets. And PKI&#x27;s traditional policies and procedures did not take into account the usage of such mechanisms for crypto asset management. The web3 industry had to develop solutions for this new use case of asymmetric keys being used as wallets.</p><p> <!-- -->Thanks to cryptographic techniques such as signature verification, multi-party computing (MPC), and smart contracts technology, two new solutions are being considered the future of crypto wallets because of their ease of use, flexibility, security, control, compatibility with current existing solutions while addressing the problems of a single point of failure. On the one hand, there are the Multi-party Computation Wallets and the Smart Wallets, also known as multi-signature (multisig) wallets.</p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-party-computation-wallets">Multi-Party Computation Wallets<a href="#multi-party-computation-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-Party Computation Wallets" title="Direct link to Multi-Party Computation Wallets">​</a></h3><div align="justify"> Firstly, multi-party computation (MPC) wallets are crypto asset wallets that can use MPC cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, or oblivious transfer. The goal of such solutions is to enable different parties to manage one private key and the assets associated with it, without one single participant knowing the whole private key. This means, not a single entity knows the private key on his own, which prevents them from accessing the funds.<p> <!-- -->Such particularity makes an MPC wallet a tool for creating a shared crypto account, with family members or with your business partners. MPC wallets help in introducing trust when required to manage crypto assets together.</p><p> <!-- -->MPC wallets are still in their early days, mainly because (secure) multi-party computation is still an evolving field in cryptographic and should still evolve in the next few years with great new techniques.</p><p>Here are some of the MPC <b>advantages</b>:</p><ul><li>Off-chain recovery.</li><li>Chain agnostic.</li><li>No gas overhead.</li><li>No need for change in Dapp for integration.</li></ul><p>Some of the <b>drawbacks</b> are:</p><ul><li>Early stage technology, libraries implementations, which is not great from a security point of view because they can have undetected vulnerabilities.</li><li>Immutability and lack of redundancy - once created, one cannot change the signers of the associated wallets.

Indeed, they are smart contracts deployed on chains and publicly available for anyone to verify. With smart wallets, similarly to MPC wallets, it is possible for a group of individuals to manage together crypto assets associated with the main smart wallet.</p><p> <!-- -->Multisig wallet owners are able to set up the minimum number of signatures required for the wallet to validate and authorize transactions. This allows them to distribute the keys associated with the main wallet account to other parties, decentralizing the responsibility of managing the funds of a project and creating redundancy.</p><p> <!-- -->Practically speaking, to authorize a transaction multiple parties have to read and validate the transaction before it can be taken into account. Thanks to this mechanism, if one of the private keys is lost or stolen, a malicious actor will not be able to access the funds without the other wallet owners. And they are notified someone is performing a suspicious transaction that can be confirmed directly with other key managers. Such a mechanism provides an additional layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets it holds.</p><p> <!-- -->Multisig wallets are important for individual users who want to keep ownership of their crypto assets. This helps solve the problem of lost hard drives where crypto wallets or seed phrases were stored. If one gets lost, they still can manage the funds and reconfigure the multisig and remove the lost key and add a new one.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="2 of 3 Multisig Wallet" src="/hashdit/assets/images/multisig-d2f2320eb53c484cb679756e125e62cb.png" width="1458" height="736" class="img_ev3q"></p><div align="center"><i>Figure 4</i>: <u>2 of 3 Multi-Signature wallet.</u></div><br><p> <!-- -->Additionally, multisig wallets can provide an additional layer of security for organizations or groups such as DAO that hold large amounts of crypto assets. By requiring multiple signatures for transactions, multisig wallets can help to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the funds. One of the main actors that can benefit from multisig wallets is the web3 projects. In recent history, many hacks such as The AscenDex hack as well as the Ankr protocol hack happened because of leaked/stolen private keys. These two projects suffered major financial losses severely impacting not only the project financials but their partners and the trust placed in them by the users, investors, and the community. Multi-sig could become a new standard.</p><p> <!-- -->Multi sig has also a very interesting added value. From the perspective of web3 projects and protocols: The increasing number of smart contracts in a decentralized application and the increasing complexity of their architecture and interactions, it becomes fundamental to provide transparency and visibility on key performance indicators such as the usage of a secure crypto wallet. They fulfill two main roles: managing crypto assets, but also performing important actions in decentralized applications such as updating the smart contract, pausing a protocol, changing the fees, etc.</p><p> <!-- -->Such information is relevant not only for web3 projects&#x27; internal security and monitoring but also to increase trust between them and business partners, customers and investors.

Both types of wallets create redundancy to prevent the mismanagement of funds by one user.</p><p> <!-- -->Even if MPC wallets display a simpler and off-chain process for wallet creation and recovery, being a little cheaper to use and more compatible with decentralized applications, they lack flexibility once they are created. Losing any of the keys required to sign a transaction prevents the parties from accessing the wallet&#x27;s funds. Smart wallets on the other hand are more flexible, users can be added or removed from the multisig wallet, and keys can be rotated, which is important in case of a security breach or a lost key. Finally, because they are smart contracts, they can implement very different functional features such as paying limits, lack of funds, and others.</p><p> <!-- -->We prefer Multi-signature wallets over other options such as multi-party computation wallets because the latter cannot be easily identified nor audited on-chain.

In total, 9 Bridge and 19 GameFi projects were exploited, a 800% and 1800% increase respectively from 2021.</p><p>With the expansion of the BSC ecosystem, other categories of projects came into the limelight such as ExerciseFi and SocialFi, which did not exist back in 2021. Some of these projects were victims of hacks as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2022-in-focus">2022 in focus<a href="#2022-in-focus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2022 in focus" title="Direct link to 2022 in focus">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-1">General<a href="#general-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General" title="Direct link to General">​</a></h4><p>In total, nearly $1.05 billion were lost to security incidents on BSC. By observing the monthly chart below, the months with the top amount loss were October, January followed by June.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/fiat_loss-17ea79ff8ff651b172b1939d4b6eaa2d.png" width="1528" height="561" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 8: Amount of stolen funds in dollars per month in 2022</p><p>In those months, the main contributing incidents were (1) BSC token hub exploit, (2) Qubit exploit, and lastly the (3) EvoDefi bridge mismanagement incident.</p><p>Interestingly, when removing these 3 outlier incidents from the chart, the total financial loss drops down to just $346.9m, a staggering 67% drop or one-third of total amount loss of 2022. Also, the average of stolen funds per incident falls to $1.2m, from the $3.7m value shared earlier in the report.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-9" src="/hashdit/assets/images/special_charts_1-684195997f22cce549be9a0612867ff5.png" width="1442" height="351" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 9: Amount of stolen funds in dollars excluding the 3 largest incidents</p><p>This chart is closely correlated to the number of security incidents monthly in 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-10" src="/hashdit/assets/images/no_of_incidents(1)-8ce80ac18d678636d96d364fca93e475.png" width="1528" height="543" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 10: Number of different project impacted by exploits</p><p>For example, the highest number of security incidents took place in October which is in line with the highest amount of loss.</p><p>However, months that have a higher number of security incidents might have a low amount of loss too. For example, even though August has 29 security incidents which is above the monthly average (23), the financial loss for that month is only $8m which is the 2nd lowest throughout the year. Such data reinforces the fact that we are seeing more incidents with lesser financial impact.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-attack-vectors-1">Type of attack vectors<a href="#type-of-attack-vectors-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of attack vectors" title="Direct link to Type of attack vectors">​</a></h4><p>Out of the 282 security incidents, crypto scams are the most common on the BNB Chain as shown below, 62.06% of security incidents are crypto scams, followed by 37.23% being hacks and 0.71% being improper management such as mismanagement of private keys.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-11" src="/hashdit/assets/images/Attack_method_number_of_incidents-1befbf26281e55f2b4570ce15f4d052a.png" width="1528" height="995" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 11: Proportion of different type of exploits</p><p>However, it is interesting to note that even when the number of scams are nearly double of hacks, the financial impact of scams are less significant than the ones related to the hacks.

The 2nd largest contributor was Business Logic Vulnerabilities within smart contracts deployed on BSC, accounting for 29.45%.</p><p>It is notable here that “low-level” scams like Rugpull and Ponzi, even though they are the most common, do not take up much of the proportion as seen in the pie chart.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-projects-1">Type of projects<a href="#type-of-projects-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type of projects" title="Direct link to Type of projects">​</a></h4><p>When focusing on the project type vs financial loss, without surprise, 60.38% of financial loss are attributed to Bridge projects. This is because cross-chain bridges generally lock large amounts of crypto assets on one chain to mint collateralized assets on the destination chain. Hackers took notice of this trend and targeted vulnerabilities within these cross-chain bridge smart contracts.</p><p>The 2nd most project type targeted was DeFi projects at 37.06%, followed by GameFi and Metaverse projects at 1.22% and 1.08% respectively.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-14" src="/hashdit/assets/images/financial_loss_per_project_type_distribution-d9c0ff9ec470298e253d672bf7b6ba2e.png" width="1528" height="995" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 14: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-10-incidents-in-2022">Top 10 incidents in 2022<a href="#top-10-incidents-in-2022" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022" title="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022">​</a></h4><p>The following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial loss in 2022.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-15" src="/hashdit/assets/images/top_10_incidents_bsc-33b1dc84d82454cb8b3c3c998ce85eb2.png" width="1528" height="925" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 15: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2022 on the BNB Smart Chain</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-10-incidents-in-2022-1">Top 10 incidents in 2022<a href="#top-10-incidents-in-2022-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022" title="Direct link to Top 10 incidents in 2022">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bsc-token-hub-exploit---572-million-loss">BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss<a href="#bsc-token-hub-exploit---572-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss" title="Direct link to BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 6th October 2022, BSC Token hub, a bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain and the BNB Smart Chain, was exploited by an attacker resulting in the unauthorized transfer of 2M BNB.</p><p>Root cause analysis confirmed a flaw in the verification algorithm implementation developed by Cosmos, and incorporated by BSC into their contract’s proof verification process. Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn’t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="qubitfinance---80-million-loss">QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss<a href="#qubitfinance---80-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss" title="Direct link to QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.</p><p>Root cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).</p><p>The legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evodefi---50-million-loss">EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss<a href="#evodefi---50-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss" title="Direct link to EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>The team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) &amp; Polygon, invested users’ funds on Terra’s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.</p><p>However, due to the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.</p><p>Thus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users’ funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund’s value.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablefund---23-million-loss">StableFund - $23 Million Loss<a href="#stablefund---23-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss" title="Direct link to StableFund - $23 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>StableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.</p><p>In reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.</p><p>The project started from 2022-06-27, where &gt;13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elephant-money---22-million-loss">Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss<a href="#elephant-money---22-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.</p><p>The root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transit-finance---21-million-loss">Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss<a href="#transit-finance---21-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for &gt; $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.</p><p>Thankfully, &gt; $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).</p><p>The root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ankr--helio---20-million-loss">ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss<a href="#ankr--helio---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for &gt; $15m, bringing the total damage to &gt; $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.</p><p>Helio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform’s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss">Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss<a href="#racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss" title="Direct link to Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.</p><p>For Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.</p><p>For the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flare---17-million-loss">$FLARE - $17 Million Loss<a href="#flare---17-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss" title="Direct link to $FLARE - $17 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the &quot;balance&quot; related data structure.</p><p>The project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this “balance” related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.</p><p>However, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss">DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss<a href="#dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss" title="Direct link to DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss">​</a></h5><p>On 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m. The hacker compromised multiple private keys of the team. As a result, the hacker removed liquidity from the projects and stole all funds from their hot wallets. The funds have already been bridged to ETH chain and deposited into Tornado Cash.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h3><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transactions. However, it is undeniable that 2022 has proven to be a tough year for both investors and developers due to the bear market and hack incidents, which impeded trust within the cryptocurrency community. Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ul><li>Understand what you&#x27;re signing, don&#x27;t blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)</li><li>Always double check that you are on the official website of the DApp</li><li>Be extra wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity</li><li>Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)</li><li>Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done</li><li>Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
If <em>High Risk</em> is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away</li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!</strong></p><p>For developers:</p><ul><li>Verify &amp; open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)</li><li>Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)</li><li>Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure</li><li>Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases</li><li>Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations</li><li>Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary</li><li>Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)</li><li>Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)</li><li>Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hashdit">Hashdit<a href="#hashdit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hashdit" title="Direct link to Hashdit">​</a></h4><p>HashDit’s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.

Most of its success is no mere temporary surge because of the developer-friendly application development process. Google offers a plethora of platforms that support the design and development, testing, and sharing of their applications. Consequently, the number of applications in the Google Play Store reached 2.6 million in 2022. </p><p>However, to put that another way, from a security standpoint, the remarkable growth of Android coupled with the fact that a large number of innocent mobile users may become potential victims of cyber attacks. One of the prevalent types of attack is something called repackaging. Repackaging refers to the practice of customizing an existing mobile app and redistributing it in the wild. Specifically, attackers modify a popular app downloaded from app markets, reverse-engineer the app, inject some malicious code, and redistribute the modified app. Because it is difficult for regular users to notice the difference between the repackaged app and the original app, victims may suffer financial loss, mainly when security-critical private and business apps they use, such as Crypto Exchange apps, are repackaged.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repackaged-android-apps">Repackaged Android Apps<a href="#repackaged-android-apps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Repackaged Android Apps" title="Direct link to Repackaged Android Apps">​</a></h2><p>Some may get astounded by the fact that Android app is prone to repackaging. We can say that Android is negligent in such an attack. That&#x27;s because of the intrinsical relation to the structural characteristics of the app distribution process. The app requires &quot;ANY&quot; valid signature to be successfully installed — they do not verify the actual identity of the signer. The app developer (even including the bad actor!) does not need a legitimate public key certificate issued by a trusted authority, indicating the possibility that an actor can modify an existing app, inject some harmful codes, and re-sign it with the self-generated private key. </p><p>What happens when you have installed the repackaged app on your mobile device?

Check the digital signature.">​</a></h3><p>With a tool called apksigner, you can check the app&#x27;s authenticity. The apksigner tool, available in revision 24.0.3 and higher of the Android SDK Build Tools, lets you sign APKs and confirm that an APK&#x27;s signature will be verified successfully on all Android platform-supported versions by that APK. Make a comparison between the original and repackaged versions — you may immediately sense the difference.</p><p>The syntax for confirming the successful verification of an APK&#x27;s signature on supported platforms is as follows:</p><p><code>apksigner verify [options] app-name.apk</code></p><p>The apksigner verify command has the following options.</p><p><strong>--print-certs</strong></p><p>Show information about the APK&#x27;s signing certificates.</p><p><strong>--min-sdk-version &lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The lowest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK&#x27;s signature will be verified. Higher values allow the tool to use more robust security parameters when signing the app but limit the APK&#x27;s availability to devices running more recent versions of Android. By default, apksigner uses the value of the minSdkVersion attribute from the app&#x27;s manifest file.</p><p><strong>--max-sdk-version &lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The highest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK&#x27;s signature will be verified. By default, the tool uses the highest possible API level.</p><p><strong>-v, --verbose</strong></p><p>Use the verbose output mode.</p><p><strong>-Werr</strong></p><p>Treat warnings as errors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>You should only trust apps obtained from official app stores. Suppose you ever downloaded the Binance app from third-party markets or have already installed it. In that case, you are probably at risk — immediate action is required: change your password, factory reset your device, fresh-install it from our official host, and please contact us for assistance.</p><p>Other apps also can be a potential backdoor. Once you use the repackaged app, the lousy actor can annoy you in countless programmatically unimaginable ways. Telegram is a good example: Hashdit once ever stumbled across an unofficial Telegram app replacing crypto wallet addresses with the bad actors&#x27; ones on-the-fly.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/web-3-security">web3-security</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/repackage">repackage</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/hashdit/blog/tags/2022">2022</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/hashdit/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/hashdit/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Introduction</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/docs/intro">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/docs/hashdit-api/api-access">API Documentations</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/hashdit/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/hashdit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Hashdit Inc.
