At times, we may collect personal information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.</p><p>If you choose not to share certain information with us, we may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you our Services. Any information you provide to us that is not required is voluntary.</p><p><strong>Blockchain participants</strong>: Please note that by virtue of the public nature of the blockchain, including the Ethereum Blockchain, the holdings and transactions associated with your cryptocurrency wallet address will be publicly available and accessible to third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address (including, but not limited to, cryptographically secure non-fungible tokens, and other blockchain securitized tokens), the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on the blockchain may not be able to be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about the user’s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so. Please review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.</p><p><strong>Personal Information Collected from Individuals</strong></p><p>We may collect the following personal information submitted to us by individuals through the Services:</p><ul><li><strong>Contact Information</strong>, such as your email address and social media handle.</li><li><strong>Crypto Information</strong>, including the website that the crypto transaction originated from, your public blockchain address associated with your self-hosted crypto wallet, crypto wallet types, amounts of digital assets and account balances.</li><li><strong>Inquiry and Communications Information</strong>, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms, to one of our email addresses, or via phone.
