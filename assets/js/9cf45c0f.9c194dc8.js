It analyzes the types of projects targeted, the common attack techniques used and the financial losses that resulted from the incidents.\\n\\n### Disclaimer\\nThe financial data provided here is accurate based on our own monitoring system and based on the $USD amount of the cryptocurrency involved at the time of the incident. Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true \u201cexploited amount\u201d of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\n1. **Q1 sees decrease in fiat losses and incident losses count compared to 2024 Q4**\\n\\nFiat losses decreased by approximately 75%, dropping from $31.9 million in 2024 Q4 to $7.7 million in 2025 Q1. At the same time, a decrease in the number of security incidents was observed, with 2024 Q4 experiencing 44 incidents compared to 30 in 2025 Q1.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. **BSC ranks fifth in Q1 fiat losses when compared to other chains**\\n\\nIn 2025 Q1, BSC (Binance Smart Chain) accounted for 0.49% of the total fiat losses across all chains, ranking fifth across other chains. Ethereum took first place, representing 95% of the total fiat losses. In terms of incident count, BSC ranked second with 32%, trailing behind Ethereum.\\n\\n\\n3. **Hot Wallet Compromises and Lack of Validation bugs were the two most substantial types of exploit, with CEX type of projects being the most targeted**\\n\\n59% of total fund losses were due to Hot Wallet Compromises, often caused by phishing attacks, malware, weak passwords, etc. The second leading attack vector was lack of validation, accounting for 16%, due to developers not checking input validation in smart contracts, leading to compromised contracts. Other issues included Business Logic Flaws, Phishing, and Price Manipulation issues.\\n\\n\\n## Q1 Comparisons\\n\\n### BSC Comparisons\\n\\n#### YoY Comparison\\n\\nWhen we compare the data with Q1 of previous years, there is a decreasing trend since 2021 except for an outlier Q1 in 2022. Q1 financial losses dropped by a smaller margin of 5.2% between 2024 and 2025, as compared to the difference between 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nThis suggests that the security of the BNB Chain has continued to improve *steadily* over the years.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-1](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/1.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 1: Q1 financial losses from 2020 - 2025\\n</p>\\n\\n#### 2025 Q1 vs Past 3 Quarters \\n\\n##### Fiat Losses\\n\\n![IMG-2](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/2.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 2: Financial losses across 2025 Q1 and the past 3 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\n* 2024 Q4 have the highest financial losses in a quarter\\n\\n* ~75% decrease in amount lost to exploits from 2024 Q4 to 2025 Q1\\n\\n##### Number of Incidents\\n\\n![IMG-3](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/3.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Number of incidents across 2025 Q1 and the past 3 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\nIn terms of incident count, that number dropped by 31% from 2024 Q4 to 30 incidents this quarter.\\n\\n## Chain Comparisons\\n\\n### Q3 Comparison to Other Blockchains\\n\\n![IMG-4](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/4.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Proportion of funds loss across chains in Q1\\n</p>\\n\\nAs seen in Figure 4, BSC ranks 5th amongst other blockchains for losses to security incidents this quarter. It accounts for 0.49% of total funds loss and 32% of total incident count. The top chain affected is Ethereum with a staggering 95% of the total losses (largely due to the largest Hack in Crypto History being the $1.5b Bybit Hack) and 42% of total incident count.\\n\\n### QoQ Analysis\\n\\nFiat Losses\\n\\n![IMG-5](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/5.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 5: Proportion of incidents across chains from 2025 Q1 and the past 3 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\nNoticeably, Ethereum still had the highest number of financial losses in each quarter of Figure 5 thus far, except for 2024 Q2 where Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin lost $308 million on BTC. \\n\\n\\n## Deep Dive on 2024 Q3 Incidents on BSC\\n\\nIn total, roughly $7.7 million was lost as a result of security incidents on BSC in 2025 Q1. As demonstrated by Figure 6 below, the month with the greatest losses was January which stands at $6.05 million. \\n\\n![IMG-6](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/6.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 6: Amount of stolen funds in dollars per month in Q1 of 2025\\n</p>\\n\\nFigure 7 shows the number of projects impacted by exploits in Q1.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-7](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/7.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 7: Number of projects impacted by exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nIn total, there were 30 incidents on BSC in Q1 2025. The highest number of security incidents took place in January, before going on a downward trend through the Quarter, ending with a mere 6 incidents in March.\\n\\n\\n### Attack vectors analysis\\n\\nOut of the total 30 security incidents, hacks made up 96%. Only 1 notable security incident was due to scams which was a single $316k phishing incident.\\n\\n![IMG-8](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/8.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 8: Proportion of types of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nProportional to the attack vector count, the financial impact of hacks will be greater as well as seen in Figure 8.\\n\\nHowever it is important to note that Phishing scams still continue to plague not just BNB Chain but other blockchains as well. According to our data, there have been at least 18k Phishing transactions detected on BNB Chain in 2025 Q1.\\n\\n#### Specific attack vectors analysis\\nFigure 9 shows the specific attack vectors and their corresponding financial losses in Q1 of 2025. \\n\\n![IMG-9](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/9.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 9: Proportion of funds lost across different types of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nIn Q1, 59% of the total funds loss were attributed to Hot Wallet Compromises. Hot wallet compromises often occur due to phishing attacks, malware, weak passwords, social engineering, software vulnerabilities, unsecured networks, insider threats, lack of two-factor authentication (2FA), outdated software, improper key management, and API exploits. \\n\\nThe second leading attack vector was Lack of Validation, which accounted for 16%. This is still a main cause of concern as we noticed developers not checking for input validation within poor designed smart contracts. This can result in untrusted calls that result in contracts being compromised.\\n\\n### Loss by Project Type\\n\\nWhen comparing the project type against financial loss, 43% of financial losses were attributed to CEX projects. \\n\\nThe second most targeted type was DeFi projects at 25%. This is followed by Payments at 17% which are likely a result of general users being scammed.\\n\\n![IMG-10](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/10.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 10: Proportion of funds lost against the type of project \\n</p>\\n\\nThe large proportion of fiat losses associated with CEX and DeFi projects. It also shows how important it is for users to only invest in reputable and well audited projects, and for developers to take precautions for Key Management and Lack of Validation issues.\\n\\nAt the same time, the constant trend of individuals getting scammed should serve as a critical reminder for users to only sign transactions that they understand and use security plug-ins where suitable.\\n\\n\\n## Top 10 Incidents in Q1 of 2025 \\n\\nThe following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial losses in Q1 of 2025.\\n\\n![IMG-11](../2025-04-11/2025-04-11-images/11.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 11: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2025 Q1 on BNB Smart Chain\\n</p>\\n\\n### Phemex_official - $3.2 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Hot Wallet Compromise\\n\\nDate: January 23, 2025\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nPhemex_official, a centralized exchange (CEX), experienced a significant security breach affecting its hot wallet across multiple blockchain networks. The breach on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) resulted in an estimated loss of approximately $3.2 million.\\n\\nRoot Cause Analysis:\\nThe security breach at Phemex_official is believed to have been caused by unauthorized access to the exchange\'s hot wallet. Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack may have been orchestrated by actors from the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Hot wallets, being connected to the internet, are inherently more susceptible to cyberattacks, making them a prime target for malicious activities.\\n\\n\\n### NoonesTech - $2.2 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Internal Breach\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nNoonesTech, a payment service provider, experienced a security compromise that led to a loss of approximately $2.2 million.\\n\\nPlatform Response:\\nFollowing the incident, NoonesTech announced maintenance activities on the platform. However, no official statement was released regarding the security breach.\\n\\n\\n### WebKeyDAO - $0.7 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Lack of Validation\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nWebKeyDAO, a DeFi project, was exploited due to a lack of validation attack, resulting in losses exceeding $0.7 million USD.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\nThe attacker exploited an unprotected function within the WebKeyDAO contract to purchase wkeyDao tokens at a significantly low price. These tokens were then sold on a decentralized exchange (DEX) for profit. The vulnerability arose because the contract did not validate the token price against the DEX price.\\n\\n### IPC - $0.59 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Business Logic Vulnerability\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nIPC, a Token DeFi project, was exploited due to a vulnerability in the implementation of a function, leading to losses exceeding $0.59 million USD.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\nThe exploit was a frontrun attack utilizing the Puissant: Payment method. The root cause of the vulnerability was found in the transfer() function, which burns tokens from the pair when selling. The function was supposed to include a timelock for transfers, preventing newly bought tokens from being sold for at least 30 minutes. However, the attacker managed to bypass this check by exploiting a logic error in the _isRemoveLP() function. This was achieved through flash swapping both tokens from the pair, allowing the attacker to circumvent the intended timelock.\\n\\n\\n### User - $0.31 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Phishing\\n\\nThroughout this quarter, multiple instances of users falling victim to phishing attacks were detected, resulting in total losses exceeding $0.31 million.\\n\\nTwo primary types of phishing transactions were observed:\\n1. **Wallet Drainers**: Scammers trick users into visiting phishing websites, where they are then deceived into signing transactions that transfer funds directly to the attackers.\\n2. **Spoofing Cases**: Users are deceived into transferring funds to a recipient that appears to be legitimate but is actually a copycat.\\n\\n\\n### Four.meme - $0.31 Million Loss\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nThe Four.meme project was compromised twice this quarter, resulting in total losses of approximately $0.31 million worth of funds.\\n\\nFirst Incident:\\n\\nDate: February 11, 2025\\nType: Business Logic Vulnerability Hack\\nAttack Process:\\nThe attacker maliciously initialized the PancakeSwap V3 Pool with an extreme price, causing the pool price to tilt.\\nA migration transaction added liquidity at the price after malicious initialization: 1 Wei token + the rest of WBNB was added.\\nThe attacker drained liquidity with a very small number of tokens and exchanged most of the WBNB.\\nCause of Attack:\\nThe platform contract neither created nor initialized the PancakeSwap V3 Pool in advance, nor did it check its sqrtPriceX96.\\nSecond Incident:\\n\\nDate: March 18, 2025\\nType: Front Running Attack\\nAttack Process:\\nThe hacker front ran by minting LP first, then once liquidity was added by the team, they immediately removed LP.\\nAnalysis:\\nIt appears that users did not exactly lose assets (their initial seeding funds are still in the Four.meme Multisig). The funds were lost in Four.meme\'s wallet.\\nThe principle is that initial seeded funds are added by users, and once it reaches a certain percentage, liquidity is added by Four.meme.\\nHacker Analysis:\\nThe hacker submitted the bundle through Bloxroute, and it might be possible to obtain some information from them.\\n\\n\\n### BADAI - $0.35 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Lack of Validation\\n\\nDate: February 20, 2025\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nThe BADAI DeFi project was exploited due to a lack of validation attack, resulting in a loss of $0.35 million.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\n\\nThe contract at address 0x57ae allowed anyone to create a token pair with BADAI and add liquidity using BADAI from the contract without proper access control or validation.\\nThe attacker exploited this by creating a fake token, adding liquidity, and then withdrawing BADAI from the newly created pair by removing liquidity.\\n\\n\\n\\n### EarnhubBSC - $0.18 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Lack of Validation\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nThe earnhubBSC project was hacked, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.18 million.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\n\\nThe attacker called the unprotected depositBNB() function to swap 226 BNB for ADACash and made a profit through sandwiching swaps.\\nThe funds on addresses 0x2d70, 0x2505393295847525577f83a8dfcb2f1a908bfe2, and 0x961149853ad31c5640ea8081459fabdd94a2a428 are likely traced to the @earnhubBSC rug-pull in late 2021 and early 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n### GAGAW - $0.1 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Business Logic Vulnerability\\n\\nDate: January 25, 2025\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nThe GAGAW DeFi project was attacked due to a business logic vulnerability, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.1 million. A previous attack one month ago inflicted a loss of $69,700 due to the same vulnerability.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\n\\nThere is a typo in the transfer function. When removing liquidity, the recipient\'s balance is mistakenly increased by the balance of _destroyAddress.\\nIf this is by design, it should instead be _balances[_destroyAddress] = _balances[_destroyAddress].add(tAmount).\\n\\n\\n### GraFunLabs - $0.1 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Reentrancy\\n\\nDate: January 17, 2025\\n\\nIncident Overview:\\nThe GraFunLabs project, a LaunchPad project, was exploited for approximately $0.1 million due to a reentrancy attack.\\n\\nExploit Details:\\n\\nThe victim contract\'s sell() method was reentered to manipulate the BNB and meme token balance, allowing the attackers to take extra BNB.\\nThe hack occurred on GraFun\'s platform (https://gra.fun/bsc/launch-token), affecting any users launching tokens through them.\\nThe launch campaign was a joint effort with DexeNetwork, which faced a $640k governance hack in December 2024.\\nThe vulnerable contract has been \\"fixed\\" with two upgrades, but the code remains unverified.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBelow we have some final tips for investors and developers:\\n\\n### For investors:\\n\\n1. **Understand What You\'re Signing:** Never blindly sign random signatures or transactions. Always ensure signatures are from official websites.\\n2. **Verify Official Websites:** Double-check that you are on the official website of the DApp.\\n3. **Exercise Caution with New/Trending Projects:** Be wary of projects that guarantee high APYs or use MEV bots. Always verify the project team\u2019s authenticity.\\n4. **Use Multiple Wallets:** Utilize different wallets for various activities\u2014hot wallets for frequent transactions and cold wallets for storing high-value funds.\\n5. **Interact with Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure you are interacting with open-source contracts and revoke approval once the interaction is complete.\\n6. **Check Risk Warnings:** Use tools like Metamask Snaps and HashDit Extension to check risk warnings of transactions.\\n7. **Heed Warnings on Trust Wallet and PancakeSwap:** Pay attention to warnings about phishing sites, malicious contracts, and dangerous tokens. If flagged as high risk, it is strongly advised to stay away.\\n\\n\\n### For BNB Chain Developers:\\n\\n1. **Verify & Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure all relevant contracts are verified and open-sourced on-chain to maintain transparency and trust.\\n2. **Conduct Audits:** Have the project audited by at least two well-known security companies and address all identified issues, including newly added code.\\n3. **Implement a Bug-Bounty Program:** Encourage the community to help maintain the security of the code by offering rewards for identifying vulnerabilities.\\n4. **Prioritize Security:** Run sufficient testing, stress-testing, and simulations for scenarios such as adverse token price fluctuations and edge cases.\\n5. **Prevent Centralization Risks:** Use multi-signature wallets instead of a single EOA wallet for operations.\\n6. **Minimize Contract Upgradeability:** Limit contract upgradeability and apply changes only when necessary.\\n7. **Secure Fund Storage:** Ensure funds are stored securely through proper key management and fund distribution.\\n8. **Implement Safeguards:** Formulate an incident response plan and introduce time locks or pausing mechanisms within smart contracts to mitigate the impact of hacks.\\n9. **Monitor System Parameters:** Continuously monitor system parameters, such as the exchange rate of tokens.\\n\\n### About Hashdit\\n\\nHashDit\u2019s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.

Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true \u201cexploited amount\u201d of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\n1. A total of **$62,895,059** was lost across **149** security incidents in 2024\\n2. This represents a decline of **61%** from 2023 total of **$162,214,631**\\n3. May saw the most loss, with **$20,624,200** across **9** incidents\\n4. Q4 was the most costly quarter, at **$31,399,100** from **88** incidents \\n5. The most financially damaging attack vector belongs to **Hot Wallet Compromise**, with $**27,040,000** in **6** incidents.\\n6. BSC ranks **6th** in total losses across chains, representing **3%** of total loss in Web3. This gave an average loss of $422,114 per incident. The 1st place went to Ethereum, representing **53%** of total loss, with **$1,075,000,000** in losses in **326** incidents. This resulted in an average loss of **$3,297,546** per incident.\\n\\n## Notable developments\\n\\n### Developments in the Wallet Drainer Scams\\nWallet Drainers are a sophisticated form of fraud that preys on users with low security awareness. These scams often operate under a \\"Scam-as-a-Service\\" model, allowing individuals to purchase malicious scripts to conduct their own scam campaigns. The primary method involves tricking users into visiting phishing websites and signing scam transactions with their crypto wallets, leading to the theft of their funds. This technique is not limited to a single blockchain but follows the flow of money across various chains. In 2024, Wallet Drainers continue to run wild, spreading havoc across ordinary users who are not careful in the space. Some of the notable instances include:\\n- Wallet Drainers have extended their reach beyond EVM chains to include networks like TON and Cardano.\\n- Scammers continue to focus on high-profile events, such as the Pudgy\u2019s PENGU airdrop, to maximize their impact.\\n- Compromised data from breaches like MailerLite and LastPass have been used to spread phishing scams.\\n- Drainers have created fake channels and social media accounts on platforms like Telegram and Discord to mislead users.\\n- Scammers have developed fake meeting software and used social engineering to trick users into downloading malware.\\n- Targeting commonly used npm packages in crypto projects, such as Solana/Web3.js and LottieFiles, to compromise multiple projects\' front ends.\\n- DNS hijacking incidents, including the major compromise of Squarespace, resulted in significant impacts on many hosted sites, such as Compound and Celer.\\n\\n### Continued rise of DPRK Scams\\nDPRK-affiliated personnel continue to target trending protocols and high-net-worth individuals in the Web3 space. Their tactics include impersonating legitimate employees to compromise projects, exfiltrate sensitive data, and steal funds over time. Notable incidents include the compromises of DMM Bitcoin and WazirX exchanges. Additionally, they exploit non-technical vulnerabilities to compromise large Total Value Locked (TVL) Web3 methods.\\n\\n### Continued rise of Spoofing Scams\\nScammers have adopted a new tactic of sending small amounts of real money to unsuspecting victims. This involves creating addresses with similar endings to those that users normally interact with and sending a few pennies. They monitor the mempool and quickly generate these addresses to follow up on original transactions. This spoofing technique has been observed on multiple non-EVM chains, including Solana (with over $3 million in losses) and Tron. The largest recorded damage was $68 million on Ethereum in May.\\n\\n## Year-over-Year (YoY)\\n\\n### General\\nIn 2024, HashDit monitored $62,895,059 funds loss on BSC. The amounts lost to exploits have continued to drop significantly since 2022, continuing the downward trend of 2023, with a YoY 61% decrease in damages, as seen from the figure below.\\n\\n![IMG-1](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/1.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 1: Total amount stolen funds (in dollars) on BSC over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\nIn total, there were 149 security incidents on BSC, representing a 64% year-over-year decrease from 2023, dropping even lower than the 2022 incident count of 286. The average number of incidents per month decreased from 34 to 12. Figure 2 shows that the increasing trend of security incidents has finally been broken in 2024 on BSC, which could signify a positive sign and turnaround in the space.\\n\\n![IMG-2](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/2.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 2: Number of incidents on BSC over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\n### Type of attack vectors\\nAnalyzing the attack vectors trends based on Financial losses, both Hacks and Scams have dropped significantly from 2023, with Hacks accounting for $50.6m (31% decrease) and Scams accounting for $12.1m (86% decrease) in 2024.\\n\\n![IMG-3](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/3.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Financial losses per attack vector over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\nIn terms of incident count, both Hacks and Scams have also shown a positive reversal trend from 2023, with 123 Hacks (41% decrease) and 25 Scams (87% decrease) in 2024.\\n\\n![IMG-4](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/4.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Number of incidents per attack vector over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\nA comparative analysis of the decrease in percentages reveals a significant reduction in both hacks and scams. This positive trend can be attributed to several key factors. Enhanced security measures on the BSC have played a crucial role in mitigating these threats. The implementation of advanced security protocols and continuous monitoring has made it more difficult for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.\\n\\nAdditionally, users are becoming more vigilant and knowledgeable about potential scams. There is a growing awareness among the community about the importance of conducting thorough due diligence (DD) before investing in new projects. This proactive approach by users, combined with the robust security efforts on BSC, has contributed to a safer and more secure environment in the crypto space.\\n\\n### Type of projects\\nThis chart represents the type of projects that were exploited since 2020.\\n\\n![IMG-5](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/5.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 5: Security Incidents per type of project over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\nIt is clear that DeFi projects are still the main targets for crypto hackers, with 104 in 2024, still a noticeable drop from 70% decrease from 2023. Many of these projects are relatively obscure and are generally categorized under decentralized finance (DeFi). They typically involve staking or rewards mechanics, which attract users looking for high returns on their investments. Despite their potential for profitability, the lack of visibility and recognition makes these projects more susceptible to risks and scams. As a result, it is crucial for investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with such DeFi projects.\\n\\n### Chain comparison\\nThe figure below shows the comparison between the chains with the top funds losses to exploits over the last 4 years.\\n\\nBSC (in green) has shown positive steps, figures dropping significantly since 2021.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Ethereum (in blue) has continued to be the largest hitting chain since 2021, maintaining its lead at the forefront. At the same time, other chains like BTC (in yellow), Blast (in dark blue) and XRP (in light purple) have shown large increases from 2023.\\n\\n![IMG-6](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/6.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 6: Biggest financial losses across chains over the last 5 years\\n</p>\\n\\n## 2024 in focus\\n\\n### General\\nIn total, roughly $62.8 million were lost to 149 security incidents on BSC.\\n\\nInterestingly, when removing the top 3 largest incidents, the total financial loss drops down to just above $30m, a large 52% drop from the total amount loss of 2024. This signifies that most of the damage is still attributed to 1 or 2 large hitting cases.\\n\\n![IMG-7](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/7.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 7: Amount of stolen funds in dollars excluding the 3 largest incidents\\n</p>\\n\\nBy observing the quarterly and monthly trends below, there are some interesting observations to be made.\\n\\n### Wallet Drainer Analysis\\nIn 2024, we closely monitored Drainer operations, observing over 500,000 drainer transactions on BNB Chain, resulting in a total loss exceeding $20 million USD.\\n\\nThe most significant incident occurred on December 11, 2024, when a user [lost](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x1cf2084e9c5965d37610e2ba40db504670114db3abecef8fc67f89d3f4da9faa) $8.3 million worth of SolvBTC.BBN and SolvBTC tokens to an Angel Drainer address on BNB Chain. Other incidents did not surpass the $1 million mark, with the second-largest being an $833,000 [loss](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x400b7583b892024db19940e2e74a26b22b188196e3c6cbff4e6663295a50daed) in January and another $830,000 [loss](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0a00ec522a95a517bfb2914e3a4b606163e604f6c9f10287a3dc3ea2a2dfb1bc) in July.\\n\\nFor comparison, on Ethereum, the total drainer amount is much more staggering, exceeding $500 million USD combined. The highest single incident involved $55 million worth of DAI tokens [stolen](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf70042bf3ae7c22f0680f8afa078c38989ed475dfbe5c8d8f30a50d4d2f45dc4) in August 2024, with these funds still residing in the scammer\'s wallets to date.\\n\\nThis highlights the growing need to educate users on security awareness when signing transactions and to adopt more security tools to aid in understanding what they are signing.\\n\\n### Spoofing Analysis\\nIn 2024, spoofing and address poisoning scams continued to proliferate. We monitored over 30 groups conducting these scams on Ethereum and BNB Chain, resulting in more than $80 million in losses across all chains. Our analysis revealed that most of these groups have a lifespan of less than one month, with the largest groups (those with the most scam funds invested) operating for more than half a year.\\n\\nThese groups employed various tactics, including:\\n- Using fake tokens that mimic actual funds transferred.\\n- Sending 0 amounts of the actual funds transferred.\\n- Sending small amounts of the actual funds being transferred.\\n\\nThese measures were used to deceive victims and execute scams effectively.\\n\\nSome of the scam profits were exited through non-KYC platforms like Exch and FixedFloat, or they were bridged to other less traceable chains such as Litecoin or Tron.\\n\\n### Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ)\\n1. On BNB Chain, Q4 sees significant increase in fiat losses compared to the rest of the quarters\\n\\nFiat losses surged by 121%, rising from $14.2 million in Q3 to $31.4 million in Q4. In fact, it represented nearly half of the total incident losses in 2024. This significant increase was primarily driven by two major incidents in Q4 2024. The first was the Radiant case, which resulted in losses amounting to $17.8 million. The second involved an individual who fell victim to a Drainer incident, suffering losses of $7.8 million. These two events were among the most damaging losses of the year, contributing substantially to the overall increase in fiat losses.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-8](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/8.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 8: Financial losses across chains over the last 4 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\n2. Across all chains in Web3, the overall losses dropped in Q4 as compared to other quarters. This is likely due to increased security education and awareness among users, even though threat actors continue to proliferate in the Web3 space. Enhanced knowledge and vigilance have empowered users to better protect their assets and avoid scams, contributing to the reduction in overall losses.\\n\\n![IMG-9](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/9.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 9: Chain comparison fund losses in Q4\\n</p>\\n\\n### Month-over-Month (MoM)\\nThe average monthly loss is calculated to be ~$5.2m, with 9 out of the 12 months being below this average reference line.\\n\\n![IMG-10](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/11.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 10: Amount of stolen funds in dollars per month in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\nIn those months above the reference line, the significant increase in fiat loss was due to one or two singular, abnormally large security events. For example, in September, there were two major incidents: the BingXOfficial hot wallet compromise for approximately $6.8 million and the CUT2024CUT price manipulation vulnerability for around $1.45 million. This indicates that, on average, losses per incident are relatively small.\\n\\nAnalyzing the trend in the number of security incidents, the chart shows that the number of cases largely peaked in April, September, and November, with the average being around 12 incidents per month.\\n\\n![IMG-11](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/10.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 11: Number of projects impacted by security exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nInterestingly, even though April has the one of the highest number of security incidents at 17, the financial loss only stands at $2.7m which is more than half of September\u2019s data. With a nearly similar count at 18, September\u2019s financial loss is more than double, at $9.4m.\\n\\n### Type of attack vectors\\nOut of the 149 security incidents, the majority were attributed to hacks, accounting for 82.55%. Scams made up 16.78%, and improper management (operational issues caused by the team\'s mismanagement) accounted for 0.67%.\\n\\n![IMG-12](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/12.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 12: Proportion of different type of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is synchronous with the financial loss of these security incidents. As shown in Figure 12, hacks resulted in a financial loss of $50.6 million, which is significantly more than the $12.1 million loss from scams.\\n\\n![IMG-13](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/13.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 13: Financial impact measured in dollars comparing different types of incidents\\n</p>\\n\\nFor further analysis of the specific attack vectors, this figure below displays this against the financial loss in 2024.\\n\\n![IMG-14](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/14.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 14: Proportion of the funds lost comparing the different type of vulnerabilities\\n</p>\\n\\nA worrying 49.01% of incidents were attributed to **Hot Wallet Compromise**, where CEXs or protocols were careless with managing security around their privileged accounts or lacked security awareness. This led to threat actors breaching their infrastructure and obtaining keys to drain funds. \\n\\nThe second largest contributor was **Phishing** among regular users, who might store substantial amounts of funds in hot wallets without being aware of the threats. Clicking on fake sites can lead to fake signatures being generated, resulting in stolen funds. \\n\\nThe third largest contributor was **Private Key Compromise** within other entities, highlighting the importance of securing keys properly and following proper security guidelines in both Web2 and Web3 environments.\\n\\n### Type of projects\\nWhen focusing on the project type versus financial loss, 48.64% of financial losses are attributed to DeFi projects. The trend of DeFi continues to lead across all major chains, including BSC. However, some developers might not be well-versed in security when writing their smart contracts, leading to investors bearing the brunt of the compromises.\\n\\nThe second most targeted type were individuals at 14.66%, followed by CEX platforms at 13.51%. Individuals continue to be a main target for scammers, especially with the rise in the crypto market bringing in a new wave of investors whose security awareness may not be strong. Wallets and security extensions play a vital role in protecting these users.\\n\\nCEX platforms also continue to be targets since they hold large amounts of funds. If the keys are not managed and stored safely, they become easy targets for hackers.\\n\\n![IMG-15](../2024-12-30/2024-12-30-images/15.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 15: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project\\n</p>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIn 2024, we observed a notable shift in the landscape of security incidents.

It analyzes the types of projects targeted, the common attack techniques used and the financial losses that resulted from the incidents.\\n\\n### Disclaimer\\nThe financial data provided here is accurate based on our own monitoring system and based on the $USD amount of the cryptocurrency involved at the time of the incident. Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true \u201cexploited amount\u201d of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\n1. **Q3 sees increase in fiat losses compared to Q2**\\n\\nFiat losses increased by approximately 50%, rising from $9.1 million in Q2 to $14.2 million in Q3. Interestingly, this increase in losses was observed despite a decrease in the number of hacks, with Q3 experiencing 34 hacks compared to 46 in Q2.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. **BSC ranks second in Q3 fiat losses when compared to other chains**\\n\\nIn Q3, BSC (Binance Smart Chain) accounted for 2.8% of the total fiat losses across all chains, ranking second. Ethereum took first place, representing 88% of the total fiat losses. In terms of incident count, BSC also ranked second with 27%, trailing behind Ethereum.\\n\\n\\n3. **Price Manipulation and Lack of Validation bugs were the two most substantial types of exploit, with DeFi type of projects being the most targeted**\\n\\n32% of total fund losses were due to price manipulation attacks, often caused by poorly designed smart contracts relying on liquidity pool prices. The second leading attack vector was lack of validation, accounting for 23.53%, due to developers not checking input validation in smart contracts, leading to compromised contracts. Other issues included reentrancy, spoofing, and rug pulls.\\n\\n\\n## Q3 Comparisons\\n\\n### BSC Comparisons\\n\\n#### YoY Comparison\\n\\nWhen we compare the data with Q3 of previous years, there is a decreasing trend. Q3 financial losses dropped by a large 68% between 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nThis suggests that the security of the BNB Chain has improved significantly over the years.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-1](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/1.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 1: Q3 financial losses from 2021 - 2024\\n</p>\\n\\n#### 2024 Q3 vs 2024 other quarters \\n\\n##### Fiat Losses\\n\\n![IMG-2](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/2.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 2: Financial losses across the first 3 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\n* Q3 have the highest financial losses in a quarter in 2024\\n\\n* ~50% increase in amount lost to exploits from Q2 to Q3\\n\\n##### Number of Incidents\\n\\n![IMG-3](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/3.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Number of incidents across the 3 quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\nIn terms of incident count, that number dropped by 26% from Q2 to Q3 to 34 incidents this quarter.\\n\\nNotable Trends\\n\\nQ3 accounted for 45.10% of amount losses in 2024 so far\\n\\n![IMG-4](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/4.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Amount lost to exploits across the previous quarters in 2024\\n</p>\\n\\n## Chain Comparisons\\n\\n### Q3 Comparison to Other Blockchains\\n\\n![IMG-5](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/5.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 5: Proportion of funds loss across all chains in Q3\\n</p>\\n\\nAs seen in Figure 5, BSC accounts for 2.8% of total funds loss and 27% of total incident count.

The total financial loss of hacks was $12.7m and the total financial loss from hacks was $1.4m, as shown in Figure 10.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-10](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/10.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 10: Financial impact measured in dollars comparing different types of incidents\\n</p>\\n\\nThis might suggest that there is a good emphasis on scam security for general BSC users. \\n\\n#### Specific attack vectors analysis\\nFigure 11 shows the specific attack vectors and their corresponding financial losses in Q3 of 2024. \\n\\n![IMG-11](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/11.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 11: Proportion of funds lost across different types of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nIn Q3, 32% of the total funds loss were attributed to Price Manipulation attacks. This could be due to poorly designed smart contracts relying on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, making them easier to manipulate with a large swap trade or flash loans by hackers.\\n\\nThe second leading attack vector was Lack of Validation, which accounted for 23.53%. This is still a main cause of concern as we noticed developers not checking for input validation within poor designed smart contracts. This can result in untrusted calls that result in contracts being compromised.\\n\\n### Loss by Project Type\\n\\nWhen comparing the project type against financial loss, 61.76% of financial losses were attributed to DeFi projects. \\n\\nThe second most targeted type was Unknown contracts at 11.76% which are obscure and unknowing contracts, where their project name could not be identified. This is followed by Individuals at 11.76% which are likely a result of general users being scammed.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-12](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/12.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 12: Proportion of funds lost against the type of project \\n</p>\\n\\nThe large proportion of fiat losses associated with DeFi projects suggests that DeFi remains the most common type of crypto project on BSC. It also shows how important it is for users to only invest in reputable and well audited projects, and for developers to take precautions for Price Manipulation and Lack of Validation issues.\\n\\nAt the same time, the constant trend of Individuals getting scammed should serve as a critical reminder for users to only sign transactions that they understand and use security plug-ins where suitable.\\n\\n## Top 10 Incidents in Q3 of 2024 \\n\\nThe following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial losses in Q3 of 2024. \\n\\n\\n![IMG-13](../2024-10-15/2024-10-15-images/13.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 13: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2024 Q3 on BNB Smart Chain\\n</p>\\n\\n### BingXOfficial - $6.8 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Hot Wallet Compromise\\n\\nOn September 20, 2024, BingXOfficial, a centralized exchange (CEX), experienced a security breach in its hot wallet across multiple chains. On the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the impact was approximately $6.8 million.\\n\\nThe root cause of the security breach at BingX was likely related to unauthorized access to the exchange\'s hot wallet. Since hot wallets are connected to the internet, they are inherently more vulnerable to cyberattacks.\\n\\n\\n### MEV Bot - $2.2 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Internal Breach\\n\\nOn August 22, 2024, an unknown MEV bot was compromised, resulting in a loss of approximately $2.2 million.\\n\\nTypically, this MEV bot contract is designed to exploit price differences in liquidity pools. However, the vulnerability in this case was due to a lack of validation of the pool contract supplied within the victim contract. This allowed the attacker to use a fake pool contract to perform a \\"swap,\\" tricking the contract into transferring funds to the attacker\'s contract.\\n\\nInterestingly, only Executors can call the vulnerable function, and the hacker was one of the validated addresses added during the setup. This suggests that an internal breach could be a likely scenario in this case.\\n\\n\\n### CUT2024CUT - $1.4 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Price Manipulation\\n\\nOn September 10, 2024, CUT2024CUT, a token DeFi project, was exploited due to a price manipulation attack, resulting in losses exceeding $1.4 million USD on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\\n\\nThe CUT project had implemented a vulnerable reward calculation system that depended on the pool reserves. This vulnerability allowed attackers to deplete the liquidity pool (LP) reserves.\\n\\n\\n### User - $1.07 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Phishing\\n\\nThroughout this quarter, we detected multiple instances of users falling victim to phishing attacks, resulting in total losses exceeding $1.07 million.\\n\\nTwo primary types of phishing transactions were observed:\\n1. **Wallet Drainers**: Scammers trick users into visiting phishing websites, where they are then deceived into signing transactions that transfer funds directly to the attackers.\\n2. **Spoofing Cases**: Users are deceived into transferring funds to a recipient that appears to be legitimate but is actually a copycat.\\n\\n\\n### UPS - $0.52 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Price Manipulation\\n\\nOn July 21, 2024, the UPS project was compromised, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.52 million worth of funds.\\n\\nThe root cause of the hack was a vulnerability in the UPS token\'s transfer mechanism. When transferring tokens to a PancakeSwap pair, the UPS token burns tokens at the pair and calls the \\"sync\\" function. The hacker exploited this mechanism to reduce the UPS reserves in the PancakeSwap pair, causing a reserves imbalance. As a result, the UPS reserve became very small, allowing the hacker to drain BUSD from the pair using only a few UPS tokens.\\n\\n\\n### Unknown Token Stake - $0.35 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Price Manipulation\\n\\nOn August 6, 2024, an unknown Token Stake contract was exploited due to a price manipulation attack, resulting in a loss of $0.35 million.\\n\\nThe root cause of the exploit was the Token Stake contract\'s reliance on an instantaneous price oracle. This made it susceptible to price oracle manipulation, allowing the attacker to profit from the Token Stake contract.\\n\\n\\n\\n### XMM - $0.29 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Price Manipulation\\n\\nOn September 14, 2024, the XMM project was hacked, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.29 million.\\n\\nThe hacker exploited a flaw in the transfer function that allowed the recipient to mint tokens. This vulnerability enabled the hacker to mint a large amount of XMM tokens at the start of the attack, allowing them to profit by dumping the tokens into the liquidity pool.\\n\\n\\n### Bankroll - $0.23 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Business Logic Vulnerability\\n\\nOn September 23, 2024, the Bankroll DeFi project was attacked due to a business logic vulnerability, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.23 million.\\n\\nThe root cause of the attack was a flaw in the `BuyFor` function, which allowed the invoked contract to be used as the `customerAddress`. This vulnerability enabled the attacker to transfer WBNB back into the victim contract, inflating the `profitPerShare_` value significantly in the distribute routine.\\n\\n\\n### Truflation - $0.23 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Malware Scam\\n\\nOn September 25, 2024, the Truflation project, a decentralized infrastructure project, was exploited for approximately $0.23 million due to a malware scam.\\n\\nThe project\'s multisig wallet had a 1 out of 1 threshold, making it highly vulnerable. The holder of the private key was easily compromised through malware as a result of social engineering. This allowed the malicious actor to scam the team into transferring funds to their account.\\n\\n\\n### Unknown project - $0.2 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Reentrancy\\n\\nOn September 25, 2024, an unknown project was exploited for approximately $0.2 million. The root cause was identified as a reentrancy vulnerability.\\n\\nInterestingly, after the initial attack transaction, the deployer invoked the victim contract\'s `emergencyWithdrawUSDT` function multiple times, each for a small amount rather than withdrawing all the funds at once. This allowed the attacker to make small, repeated profits.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBelow we have some final tips for investors and developers:\\n\\n### For investors:\\n\\n1. **Understand What You\'re Signing:** Never blindly sign random signatures or transactions. Always ensure signatures are from official websites.\\n2. **Verify Official Websites:** Double-check that you are on the official website of the DApp.\\n3. **Exercise Caution with New/Trending Projects:** Be wary of projects that guarantee high APYs or use MEV bots. Always verify the project team\u2019s authenticity.\\n4. **Use Multiple Wallets:** Utilize different wallets for various activities\u2014hot wallets for frequent transactions and cold wallets for storing high-value funds.\\n5. **Interact with Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure you are interacting with open-source contracts and revoke approval once the interaction is complete.\\n6. **Check Risk Warnings:** Use tools like Metamask Snaps and HashDit Extension to check risk warnings of transactions.\\n7. **Heed Warnings on Trust Wallet and PancakeSwap:** Pay attention to warnings about phishing sites, malicious contracts, and dangerous tokens. If flagged as high risk, it is strongly advised to stay away.\\n\\n\\n### For BNB Chain Developers:\\n\\n1. **Verify & Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure all relevant contracts are verified and open-sourced on-chain to maintain transparency and trust.\\n2. **Conduct Audits:** Have the project audited by at least two well-known security companies and address all identified issues, including newly added code.\\n3. **Implement a Bug-Bounty Program:** Encourage the community to help maintain the security of the code by offering rewards for identifying vulnerabilities.\\n4. **Prioritize Security:** Run sufficient testing, stress-testing, and simulations for scenarios such as adverse token price fluctuations and edge cases.\\n5. **Prevent Centralization Risks:** Use multi-signature wallets instead of a single EOA wallet for operations.\\n6. **Minimize Contract Upgradeability:** Limit contract upgradeability and apply changes only when necessary.\\n7. **Secure Fund Storage:** Ensure funds are stored securely through proper key management and fund distribution.\\n8. **Implement Safeguards:** Formulate an incident response plan and introduce time locks or pausing mechanisms within smart contracts to mitigate the impact of hacks.\\n9. **Monitor System Parameters:** Continuously monitor system parameters, such as the exchange rate of tokens.\\n\\n### About Hashdit\\n\\nHashDit\u2019s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.

For this July 2024 edition, the total losses amounted to $282.5 million, showing a 25% decrease compared to July 2023 ($377.2 million). \\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n## Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n### Li.Fi protocol - $10m - Lack of Validation\\n\\nChain: Ethereum\\n\\nLi.Fi protocol is a bridge aggregation protocol with DEX connectivity and cross-chain data messaging capabilities. On July 16 2024, in this incident, the GasZipFacet contract was upgraded, introducing a vulnerable code which resulted in a compromise of approximately $10 million.\\n\\nInterestingly, a similar exploit 2 years ago, when Li.Fi was also compromised for the same vulnerability. \\n\\n**Root cause**: The primary cause of the incident was no validation of swapCallData in the LibSwap.sol library. This calldata can be externally controlled in the outer function depositToGasZipERC20 method. This allows arbitrary calls whereby funds approved to this victim contract can be abused and stolen.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x602d810c47a9022b422cf2fa32ec973f887a72df78d40e448d511e82eba5a38a)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-08-07-images/1.png)\\n![IMG-2](./2024-08-07-images/2.png)\\n\\n### Rho Markets - $7.6m - Oracle Manipulation\\n\\nChain: Scroll\\n\\nRho Markets is a liquidity platform built on Scroll, based on an overcollateralized lending model (which is a fork of Compound Finance). On July 19, 2024, in this incident, a misconfigured oracle provided the wrong price of $ETH for the rETH market ($BTC price was fed instead). Thankfully, an MEV bot front ran the original hacker and was able to safeguard the $7.6 million and return them back to the project party.\\n\\n**Root cause**: On July 16, 2024, after updating the smart contract for a new market, Rho Markets found that ETH and BTC price oracles were giving contradictory feeds due to a deployment script misconfiguration. This reversed BTC and ETH prices, creating arbitrage opportunities for MEV bots. Incorrect oracle pricing led to assets(USDC, USDT, wstETH, STONE, and wrsETH) being borrowed up to their caps. \\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Oracle misconfiguration tx](https://scrollscan.com/tx/0x30879b0dbee84ba41aa1fc6ef71e81a8985bf8509796ca45f30ec4640b338db4)\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://scrollscan.com/tx/0x0a7b4c6542eb8f37de788c8848324c0ae002919148a4426903b0fb4149f88f05 )\\n\\nTransaction snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-08-07-images/3.png)\\n\\n### DoughFina - $1.8m - Lack of Validation\\n\\nChain: Ethereum\\n\\nOn July 12, 2024, DoughFina, a DeFi project, had its ConnectorDeleverageParaswap contract compromised, resulting in a loss of ~$1.8 million. In this attack, there was a lack of validation issue which allowed anyone to withdraw funds from the vulnerable contract.\\n\\n\\n**Root cause**: The primary cause of the incident was that there is lack of validation in the flash loan call back data which leads to a WETH transfer.\\n\\nAfter invoking the flashloan method of the ConnectorDeleverageParaswap contract, the flash loan call data allowed multiple operations to be executed afterwards.\\n\\nThis allowed the hacker to burn AaveWETH from one of Dough\u2019s pools. WETH is then approved to the Victim contract which can then be transferred from out to the hacker.\\n\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x92cdcc732eebf47200ea56123716e337f6ef7d5ad714a2295794fdc6031ebb2e)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x28a934816ed0371a3fbb2f89986eecf87a22937c40309ff2f58697792215b4da)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-4](./2024-08-07-images/4.png)\\n![IMG-5](./2024-08-07-images/5.png)\\n\\n\\n### Minterest - $1.4m - Exchange rate manipulation\\n\\nChain: Mantle\\n\\nMinterest is a blockchain cross-chain DeFi lending protocol that redistributes 100% of the value captured back to users. On July 15, 2024, its MUSDYToken_Mantle contract was compromised, leading to an estimate loss of ~$1.4m on Mantle (ETH and Taiko not affected).\\n\\n\\n**Root cause**: The exchange rate of the Minterest is dependent on the token cash balance (updated immediately during token transfers, instead of at the end of the state).\\n\\nReentrancy vulnerability in which an attacker could loan out tokens that they had previously just borrowed from the protocol.\\n\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/tx/0xb3c4c313a8d3e2843c9e6e313b199d7339211cdc70c2eca9f4d88b1e155fd6bd)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-08-07-images/6.png)\\n\\n### Monoswap - $1.3m - Social Engineering\\n\\nChain: Blast\\n\\nMonoswap is a community-driven and yield-focused v3 Decentralized Exchange built to facilitate the Blast ecosystem.. On the 24th of July, 2024, due to a social engineering exploit of one of its developers, the deployer wallet was compromised, resulting in financial losses approximating $1.3 million in ETH. \\n\\n**Root cause**: One of Monoswap developers installed phishing software from https[:]//kakaocall[.]kr. The scammer pretended to be a VC institution to deceive the developer\'s trust and carried out phishing attacks.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://blastscan.io/tx/0xc78fdbaa98e7652a3495df6fcdb5797d8ecf949e014b11c72fe1421e3f806272) \\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://blastscan.io/tx/0x348bee9fb6ceb6512f7b095702f6e0616870b7c1befbe94c5e42a86b48eaa9c7) \\n\\n[Hack tx 3](https://blastscan.io/tx/0x430efd649ef7a5273f2fa084dc330d1326766a4811e2c35d568a83bd0bc9bfd8)\\n\\nTransaction snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-7](./2024-08-07-images/7.png)\\n\\n## Key lessons for developers\\n\\n1. Given the risk of social engineering attacks, it is essential for employees to install only trusted software and exercise heightened caution when working with third parties. Specifically, be vigilant for potential red flags, including:\\n\\n    * **Educate and Train Team Members:** \\n    \\n        * **Awareness Programs**: Regularly conduct training sessions to educate team members about the various types of social engineering attacks, such as phishing, vishing (voice phishing), and smishing (SMS phishing).\\n\\n        * **Simulated Attacks**: Perform simulated social engineering attacks to test and improve the team\'s response to real threats.\\n\\n        * **Trusted Software**: Always verify the source before installing any software. Ensure that you download applications only from official websites or trusted platforms, and avoid using pirated or cracked versions. Additionally, check for reviews and ratings, and consult with your IT department if you are unsure about the legitimacy of the software.\\n\\n    * **Secure Communication Channels:** \\n\\n        * **Encrypted Communication**: Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive information and authentication processes.\\n\\n        * **Verification Protocols**: Establish protocols for verifying the identity of individuals before sharing sensitive information or performing critical actions.\\n\\n    * **Limit Access and Permissions:** \\n\\n        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to ensure that team members only have access to the information and systems necessary for their role.\\n\\n        * **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of access permissions to ensure they are up-to-date and appropriate.\\n\\n2. Input validation is a crucial process - it\'s essential to verify all potential user inputs, especially when these inputs affect changes to the state of the system. This holds particularly true in the below scenarios:\\n\\n    * **Calldata Parameters:** Given that attackers have the ability to craft any data, extra validation steps must be in place for calldata parameters.\\n\\n    * **User Approvals:** During the process where the protocol contract manages users\' approvals, meticulous input checks are paramount to prevent potential malicious activities.\\n\\n3. To guard against price manipulation, it\'s essential to ensure that updated prices cannot be influenced to reflect unexpected values. Oracles, both on-chain and off-chain types, can be employed by developers. Here\'s how:\\n\\n    * **Set Boundaries**: Implementing limits can block prices from being abruptly manipulated to an impossible value, regardless of the oracle type in use.\\n\\n    * **Fallback Oracle**: Integrate a secondary oracle as a fallback measure. This ensures that if the initial oracle fails, there is a backup in place to verify the consistency of prices. By doing so, it ensures continuous, reliable price feeds, and safeguards against single point of failure.\\n\\n    * **Test scripts**: Test scripts can be designed to check the integrity of the data being fed into the Oracle system. By running these scripts, you can ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent with the expected format and values. This helps in identifying and correcting any discrepancies early in the process.\\n\\n4. Tips to Prevent Exchange Rate Manipulation:\\n\\n    * **Educate and Train Team Members:** Use multiple, independent oracle sources to fetch exchange rates. Aggregating data from various sources can help ensure accuracy and reduce the risk of manipulation from a single compromised source.\\n\\n    * **Use Strong 2FA Mechanisms:** Implement validation checks to ensure the consistency and accuracy of exchange rate data. Cross-verify rates with other reliable sources to detect anomalies.\\n\\n    * **Monitor and Respond to Suspicious Activity:** Ensure that exchange rate data is transmitted securely using encryption protocols. This helps prevent interception and tampering of data during transmission.\\n\\n    * **Secure Communication Channels:**  In the context of exchange rate systems, a reentrancy attack could be particularly damaging. For example, if an exchange rate contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, an attacker could exploit this to manipulate the exchange rates.\\n\\n        * **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:** Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. This reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n        * **Reentrancy Guards:** Implement reentrancy guards, such as mutexes, to prevent multiple calls to a function before the first call is resolved.\\n   \\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true \u201cexploited amount\u201d of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.\\n\\n\\n## 2024 H1 in focus\\n\\n### General\\n\\nIn 2024 H1, approximately $17.29 million were lost to 73 security incidents on BSC. By observing the monthly chart below, the months with the top amount loss were May, March followed by January. The highest number of security incidents took place in April at 17.\\n\\n![IMG-1](./1.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 1: Amount of stolen funds in dollars and number of incidents per month in 2024 H1\\n</p>\\n\\n### Against other chains\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 2: Financial Loss and number of exploits across chains for 2024 H1 \\n(Smaller chain incidents are grouped under \u201cOthers\u201d)\\n</p>\\n\\nIn the first half of 2024, BSC recorded $17.29 million in losses across 73 incidents, accounting for 1.4% of the total losses. Among all blockchains, BSC ranked 8th in terms of financial losses and 2nd in the number of exploits.\\n\\nIn contrast, Ethereum experienced the highest losses and the greatest number of attacks. Continuing the trend from 2023, Ethereum remained the blockchain with the largest loss amount in the first half of 2024. There were 208 exploits on Ethereum, resulting in $535 million in losses, which represented 43% of the total losses.\\n\\n### With H1 previous years\\n\\nWhen we compare the data with H1 of previous years, there is a decreasing trend of financial losses (excluding 2020), which can signify that the security posture of BNB Chain has improved over the years. \\n\\n![IMG-3](./3.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Financial Loss across the previous H1 of 2020 - 2024\\n</p>\\n\\nIn 2021, the decentralized finance (DeFi) market experienced unprecedented growth, with numerous protocols launching without adequate security measures. This lack of security awareness allowed malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.\\n\\nSince then, there has been a stronger emphasis on security for DeFi protocols, leading to a significant reduction in impactful exploits. As a result, financial losses in the first half of 2024 dropped by 83% compared to the same period in 2023 ($101 million), marking a substantial improvement.\\nAttack vectors analysis\\n\\nOut of the 73 security incidents, hacks take up 80.82%, while 19.18% are scams.\\n\\n![IMG-4](./4.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Proportion of different type of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nThis correlates to the financial loss of hacks and scams in the first half of 2024.

Notably, 7 out of these 10 incidents were due to private key compromises, which collectively accounted for $9.91 million, representing a significant 76% of the total losses. This highlights a concerning trend in the nature of exploits, emphasizing the critical need for enhanced security measures to protect private keys.\\n\\n#### AlexLabBTC - $4.3 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Private key compromise \\n\\nOn May 15, the AlexLabBTC bridge on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was compromised. The attacker gained control of the bridge upgrader role\'s key and executed a malicious proxy upgrade. This upgrade introduced a harmful withdrawal method, which allowed the hacker to drain the bridge\'s funds.\\n\\n#### User - $1.54 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Social Engineering and Phishing \\n\\nIn the first half of the year, users on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have incurred losses amounting to at least $1.54 million in cryptocurrency. These losses are predominantly attributed to social engineering and phishing attacks, which have been disseminated through fake social media accounts, fraudulent websites, and phishing emails. A significant contributor to these attacks is Inferno Drainer, a malicious wallet drainer that specifically targets and steals funds from ordinary users.\\n\\n\\n#### NFPrompt - $1.5 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Private key compromise \\n\\nOn March 14, NFPrompt, a DeFi protocol, experienced a security breach. The attack targeted one of its Swap contracts containing USDT and NFP. The hacker compromised the owner\'s private key, enabling them to invoke an owner-privileged withdrawal function. This allowed the attacker to retrieve all the funds held in the contract.\\n\\n#### Duelbits - $1.1 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Hot wallet compromise\\n\\nOn February 14, the gambling platform Duelbits was attacked, resulting in the theft of approximately $1.1 million worth of cryptocurrency. The stolen funds were subsequently bridged to Ethereum and deposited into Tornado Cash. The primary cause of the breach was the compromise of a Duelbits hot wallet.\\n\\n#### CoinsPaid - $1.0 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Hot wallet compromise \\n\\nOn January 6, the cryptocurrency exchange CoinsPaid was attacked, resulting in the theft of approximately $1 million worth of BNB funds.\\n\\n#### XBridge - $0.82 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Wrong Proxy Upgrade\\n\\nOn April 24, XBridge, a product of SaitaChainCoin, was attacked, resulting in a total loss of approximately $0.82 million. The breach occurred due to the project team introducing an incorrect mapping, which allowed anyone to assume a privileged role and withdraw tokens from the bridge contract.\\n\\n\\n#### PolyhedraZK - $0.76 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Private key compromise \\n\\nOn March 13, PolyhedraZK, an infrastructure project, was compromised, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.76 million. The hacker gained control of the key for the bridge upgrader role and executed a malicious proxy upgrade.

The breach was primarily due to a validation bug in a contract, which allowed the hacker to steal approved funds.\\n\\n#### BitForex - $0.66 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Hot wallet compromise\\n\\nOn February 26, the cryptocurrency exchange BitForex was compromised, resulting in the theft of approximately $0.66 million worth of funds.\\n\\n#### SerenityShield - $0.59 Million Loss\\nAttack type: Private key compromise \\n\\nOn February 27, the infrastructure project SerenityShield had one of its hot wallets compromised, which resulted in approximately $0.59 million worth of funds stolen. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn the first half of 2024, total losses caused by hacks, phishing scams, and rug pulls dropped to $17.2 million, compared to $101 million in the same period in 2023. This significant reduction indicates an overall improvement in the security situation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\\n\\nIn 2023, the most damaging attack vector was rug pulls. However, in 2024, the most damaging attacks have shifted to price manipulation. This change underscores the critical need for web3 projects to avoid reliance on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools and not depend solely on the balance of tokens in a contract. It is essential to consider the risks associated with flash loans and direct transfers that can impact token prices. To enhance security, projects should consider using entity oracles like Chainlink for a secure price feed.\\n\\nBelow we have some final tips for investors and developers:\\n\\nFor investors:\\n1. **Understand What You\'re Signing:** Never blindly sign random signatures or transactions. Always ensure signatures are from official websites.\\n2. **Verify Official Websites:** Double-check that you are on the official website of the DApp.\\n3. **Exercise Caution with New/Trending Projects:** Be wary of projects that guarantee high APYs or use MEV bots.

For this June 2024 edition, the total losses amounted to $56.4 million, showing a 276% increase compared to June 2023 ($15 million). \\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n## Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n### Uwulend - $23.7m - Price Manipulation\\n\\nChain: Ethereum\\n\\nUwulend is a DeFi protocol where users can participate as depositors, borrowers or LP stakers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) fashion. On June 10 2024, in this incident, the Market contracts used an unreliable averaged-out oracle which resulted in an initial compromise of $20 million.\\n\\nAfter the project paused and unpaused the protocol, they were once again exploited for another $3.7 million just 3 days later.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The price oracle used took 11 different prices, and used the median price as the price oracle. However, 5 of these prices were spot prices and directly under the control of the attacker. This meant that only one EMA price needed to be manipulated.\\n\\nThe second issue is that the input prices are in USDE, but the oracle output is in sUSDE, which currently trades around 1.08. The oracle converts between them with an owner controlled conversion factor. This conversion was set to 1.03 three months ago, and has been steadily more wrong over time as the price of sUSDE goes up with yield.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x242a0fb4fde9de0dc2fd42e8db743cbc197ffa2bf6a036ba0bba303df296408b)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-07-17-images/1.png)\\n![IMG-2](./2024-07-17-images/2.png)\\n\\n### Velocore - $6.8m - Lack of validation\\n\\nChain: Linea & Zksync\\n\\nOn the 2nd of June, 2024, Velocore is a Layer-2 protocol that leverages ZK technology to enhance Ethereum scalability. Due to a Lack of validation vulnerability in the smart contract, Velocore experienced a security breach on June 2nd, 2024, resulting in financial losses approximating $6.8 million in ETH.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The root cause of this compromise was due to vulnerabilities within the Balancer-style CPMM pool contract, specifically the \u2018velocore__execute\u2019 function. The vulnerability here is that `effectiveFee1e9` was allowed to exceed 100% - that is 1e18 (take note of the \u2018unchecked\u2019 block). This resulted in an underflow, changing a withdrawal into a large deposit.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x47e123af93add709bc2516f6a5db057dfbb1d66a75b693cd7980cd3eb28c7357)\\n\\n[Malicious upgrade tx](https://www.bscscan.com/tx/0x55bb186c80834ffe00ac673b02fb1e70ac4fad56d4407afcf8bf4f1d716f579e)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-07-17-images/6.png)\\n![IMG-4](./2024-07-17-images/7.png)\\n\\n### Loopring - $5m - Social Engineering\\n\\nChain: Ethereum\\n\\nLoopring is a zkRollup Layer 2. It allows for high-throughput, low-cost trading and payment on Ethereum. On June 9, 2024, in this attack, some Loopring Smart Wallets were targeted in a security breach. Subsequently, the attacker transferred assets out of the affected wallets. This resulted in a loss of approximately $5 million across the wallets.\\n\\n\\n**Root cause**: The attack succeeded by compromising Loopring\'s 2FA service, allowing the hacker to impersonate the wallet owner (by obtaining the right signature) and gain approval for the Recovery from the Official Guardian.\\n\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf0a02e3dc32e380f5fbc832981963277f7b2ce9345040ddf1f3016724b84e251 )\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-5](./2024-07-17-images/3.png)\\n\\n\\n### Bazaar - $1.4m - Lack of Validation\\n\\nChain: Blast\\n\\nOn June 10, 2024, Bazaar, a DeFi project, had its BazaarVaultBlast contract compromised, resulting in a loss of ~$1.4 million. In this attack, there was a lack of validation issue which allowed anyone to withdraw funds from the vulnerable contract.\\n\\n\\n**Root cause**: The vulnerable function exitPool() did not validate its caller, which means that a malicious actor could invoke this method and parse another user\u2019s balance to withdraw their funds to himself.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://blastscan.io/tx/0x7fdd140f7631f62d62f7256ee4a38af51a4723ad5d66adc9b9685bf78f750f2d )\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-07-17-images/4.png)\\n\\n### Holograph - $1.3m - Insider Attack\\n\\nChain: Ethereum\\n\\nHolograph is an omnichain tokenization protocol, enabling asset issuers to mint natively composable omnichain tokens. On June 13, 2024, the incident involved a misused HLG created on Mantle that was activated through Layerzero bridge. There was a Falsified packet that was executed on Mantle which resulted in a large mint of 1 billion HLG tokens on Ethereum, valued around $1.3 million at the time.\\n\\n\\n**Root cause**: It was a private key compromise that was later on confirmed by Holograph, this was an insider attack. A former contractor exploited Holograph Protocol to mint additional HLG. The malicious actor deployed an unverified contract on Mantle, which was used to mint additional HLG.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Large mint tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0cc143ccf3316d47b36a2e45577922f4ebe2374966bb22c1e9cf49c747d46396)\\n\\n[Mantle packet tx](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/tx/0x845dafdac3d55238e8cf005ae2daaac5f651ff4b3eaf56945377a7f6c8366449 )\\n\\nTransaction snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-7](./2024-07-17-images/5.png)\\n\\n## Key lessons for developers\\n\\n1. In light of potential insider compromises, it\'s crucial to apply thorough background checks for new employees. Specifically, keep an eye out for potential red flags including:\\n\\n    * **Preference for certain platforms:** Malicious developers seem to favor using Github, often impersonating user profiles such as SuperTalentedDev726 or CryptoKnight415.\\n\\n    * **Use of numbers:** Both email addresses and Github usernames often contain numerical sequences. It\'s suspected they use this as a method for tracking the identities they impersonate.\\n\\n    * **Asian identities:** There\'s a tendency toward choosing Japanese (and possibly Korean) identities, often claiming prior education in Japan.\\n\\n    * **Prominent educational background:** The falsified credentials often include elite universities in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Such institutions may include Singapore State University, Nanyang Technological University, University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\\n\\n    * **Codebase theft:** While not always the case, these imposters often steal existing projects from GitHub and recondition the commit messages to reflect their assumed usernames.\\n\\n    * **Multiple applications:** They tend to apply repeatedly for the same job, resorting to multiple email addresses for their submissions.\\n\\n    * **Premature expertise:** They often claim experience in Solidity/EVM too early (such as in 2015), which is an unlikely scenario giving the nascent state of blockchain technology at the time.\\n\\n2. To guard against price manipulation, it\'s essential to ensure that updated prices cannot be influenced to reflect unexpected values. Oracles, both on-chain and off-chain types, can be employed by developers. Here\'s how:\\n\\n    * **Set Boundaries:** Implementing limits can block prices from being abruptly manipulated to an impossible value, regardless of the oracle type in use.\\n\\n    * **Fallback Oracle:** Integrate a secondary oracle as a fallback measure. This ensures that if the initial oracle fails, there is a backup in place to verify the consistency of prices. By doing so, it ensures continuous, reliable price feeds, and safeguards against single point of failure.\\n\\n3. Input validation is a crucial process - it\'s essential to verify all potential user inputs, especially when these inputs affect changes to the state of the system. This holds particularly true in the below scenarios:\\n\\n    * **Calldata Parameters:** Given that attackers have the ability to craft any data, extra validation steps must be in place for calldata parameters.\\n\\n    * **User Approvals:** During the process where the protocol contract manages users\' approvals, meticulous input checks are paramount to prevent potential malicious activities.\\n\\n4. Here are five key tips to protect against social engineering attacks that compromise 2FA for Web3 protocol teams:\\n\\n    * **Educate and Train Team Members** \\n\\n        * **Awareness Programs**: Regularly conduct training sessions to educate team members about the various types of social engineering attacks, such as phishing, vishing (voice phishing), and smishing (SMS phishing).\\n\\n        * **Simulated Attacks**: Perform simulated social engineering attacks to test and improve the team\'s response to real threats.\\n\\n    * **Use Strong 2FA Mechanisms** \\n\\n        * **Hardware Tokens**: Encourage the use of hardware-based 2FA tokens (e.g., YubiKey) instead of SMS-based 2FA, which is more susceptible to SIM swapping attacks.\\n\\n        * **App-Based 2FA**: If hardware tokens are not feasible, use app-based 2FA solutions like Google Authenticator or Authy, which are more secure than SMS.\\n\\n    * **Monitor and Respond to Suspicious Activity** \\n\\n        * **Anomaly Detection**: Implement systems to detect and alert on unusual login attempts or behavior that could indicate a compromised account.\\n\\n        * **Immediate Response**: Have a clear incident response plan in place to quickly address and mitigate any suspected social engineering attacks.\\n\\n    * **Secure Communication Channels** \\n\\n        * **Encrypted Communication**: Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive information and authentication processes.\\n\\n        * **Verification Protocols**: Establish protocols for verifying the identity of individuals before sharing sensitive information or performing critical actions.\\n\\n    * **Limit Access and Permissions** \\n\\n        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to ensure that team members only have access to the information and systems necessary for their role.\\n\\n        * **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of access permissions to ensure they are up-to-date and appropriate.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

For this May 2024 edition, the total losses mounted up to $92.3 million, showing a 16% increase compared to May 2023. \\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n## Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n### GoGalaGames - $21.7m - Private Key Compromise\\n\\nGoGalaGames is a GameFi protocol that allows players to earn cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through gameplay. In this incident, its minting role\u2019s private key was compromised, leading to a mint of 5,000,000,001 GALA tokens, an estimated loss of ~$222m on ETH. Interestingly, only a portion of GALA tokens were swapped for ETH, amounting to an estimate of 5913 ETH or $22m USD.\\n\\nThankfully, funds have since been returned and sent to an address termed as Gala Fund Recovery. Also, the excess GALA tokens have been burned. \\n\\n**Root cause**: The hacker was able to compromise the private key of the original Minter account. It is unclear if it was an internal or external attack.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Mint tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa6d90abe17d17743a9cecab84bcefb0fd0bbfa0c61bba60fd2f680b0a2f077fe)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-06-04-images/1.png)\\n\\n### SonneFinance - $20m - Empty Market Attack\\n\\nSonne Finance is a decentralized lending protocol for individuals, institutions and protocols to access financial services. It is a permissionless, open source and Optimistic protocol serving users on Optimism. Users can deposit their assets, use them as collateral and borrow against them. In this attack, the hacker made use of a mislapse in the protocol\u2019s market configuration to execute an empty market attack.\\n\\n**Root cause**: Sonne was aware of the empty market bug, and planned to:\\n - timelock add a market\\n - user add funds\\n - timelock open up the market for use.\\n\\nIt would work, as long as the order was followed. However, they scheduled the supportMarket operation independently, instead of using scheduleBatch. Additionally, they opened the EXECUTOR_ROLE to everyone. This essentially allowed anyone to execute the operations in any order.\\n\\nThe exploited solVELO market was deployed 4 days ago without any liquidity, and added to the Unitroller 2 days later after timelock. As such, this empty market was abused with direct donation to borrow funds from other markets with liquidity.  \\n\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xb43748ed668c1e44cf0a3e829ca0fe24eceaee7d33d06072bb11ca99afa7f448)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x9312ae377d7ebdf3c7c3a86f80514878deb5df51aad38b6191d55db53e42b7f0)\\n\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2024-06-04-images/2.png)\\n![IMG-3](./2024-06-04-images/3.png)\\n\\n\\n### ALEXLabBTC - $4.3m - Private Key Compromise\\n\\nOn May 15, 2024, ALEXLabBTC, a DeFi project, had an unverified contract compromised, after a malicious upgrade. The potential loss was ~$12m, however the attacker was thankfully inexperienced. The attacker was successfully able to transfer around 13.8 million STX (~$2 million) on the Stack BTC layer-2 chain. \\n\\nHowever, on BSC where the potential damage was $4.3m, a white hat was able to secure funds, and eventually returned all 100% to the project team. On ETH, the exploiter tried to steal assets notionally worth around $5 million, but failed to do so. ALEX Lab later announced they were able to recover or secure around $4.5 million of those assets (through CEX).\\n\\n**Root cause**: Using compromised private keys obtained via a phishing attack. The exploiter was able to upgrade the code to a malicious logic contract and drain some assets from the ALEX protocol.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x47e123af93add709bc2516f6a5db057dfbb1d66a75b693cd7980cd3eb28c7357)\\n\\n[Malicious upgrade tx](https://www.bscscan.com/tx/0x55bb186c80834ffe00ac673b02fb1e70ac4fad56d4407afcf8bf4f1d716f579e)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-4](./2024-06-04-images/4.png)\\n\\n### Pump.fun - $1.9m - Insider Attack\\n\\nPump.fun is a Solana Based Memecoin Launchpad that allows users to deploy their own Solana tokens. The incident involved a former employee gaining pump.fun\'s admin privileges, resulting in the misappropriation of approximately 12,300 SOL, valued around $1.9 million at the time.\\n\\n**Root cause**: A former employee, illegitimately taken access of the withdraw authority using their privileged position at the company, used flash loans on a Solana lending protocol.\\n\\nThe loans were used to borrow SOL to buy out as many memecoins until they hit 100% on their bonding curves, which allowed the exploiter to gain liquidity to repay the flash loans. This affected roughly $1.9 million out of a total of $45 million in liquidity within the bonding curve contracts during a specific timeframe.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://solscan.io/tx/4i1BarkRVtU1RU7eaaTBKrbeDPPVD2D2LcyGFWu1tqCJUsGfkQc61YfsCWz1mQdhknjvP862EoGhs8dgpCVShoED)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-5](./2024-06-04-images/5.png)\\n\\n### NORMIE - $800k - Price Manipulation\\n\\nOn the 26th of May, 2024, the Base network suffered a damaging exploit targeted at the memecoin, NORMIE. Due to a vulnerability in the smart contract, there was an unfortunate loss of approximately 224.98 ETH.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The fundamental catalyst for the exploit was a flaw in the smart contract logic. This flaw granted the attacker the capability to trick the contract into acknowledging their address as a privileged one. This deceptive maneuver allowed them to mint tokens without authorization, circumventing crucial security measures, and consequently leading to a significant financial loss.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://basescan.org/tx/0xa618933a0e0ffd0b9f4f0835cc94e523d0941032821692c01aa96cd6f80fc3fd)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-06-04-images/6.png)\\n![IMG-7](./2024-06-04-images/7.png)\\n\\n## Key lessons for developers\\n\\n1. In light of potential insider compromises, it\'s crucial to apply thorough background checks for new employees. Specifically, keep an eye out for potential red flags including:\\n\\n    * **Preference for certain platforms:** Malicious developers seem to favor using Github, often impersonating user profiles such as SuperTalentedDev726 or CryptoKnight415.\\n\\n    * **Use of numbers:** Both email addresses and Github usernames often contain numerical sequences. It\'s suspected they use this as a method for tracking the identities they impersonate.\\n\\n    * **Asian identities:** There\'s a tendency toward choosing Japanese (and possibly Korean) identities, often claiming prior education in Japan.\\n\\n    * **Prominent educational background:** The falsified credentials often include elite universities in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Such institutions may include Singapore State University, Nanyang Technological University, University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\\n\\n    * **Codebase theft:** While not always the case, these imposters often steal existing projects from GitHub and recondition the commit messages to reflect their assumed usernames.\\n\\n    * **Multiple applications:** They tend to apply repeatedly for the same job, resorting to multiple email addresses for their submissions.\\n\\n    * **Premature expertise:** They often claim experience in Solidity/EVM too early (such as in 2015), which is an unlikely scenario giving the nascent state of blockchain technology at the time.\\n\\n2. To guard against price manipulation, it\'s essential to ensure that updated prices cannot be influenced to reflect unexpected values. Oracles, both on-chain and off-chain types, can be employed by developers. Here\'s how:\\n\\n    * **Set Boundaries:** Implementing limits can block prices from being abruptly manipulated to an impossible value, regardless of the oracle type in use.\\n\\n    * **Fallback Oracle:** Integrate a secondary oracle as a fallback measure. This ensures that if the initial oracle fails, there is a backup in place to verify the consistency of prices. By doing so, it ensures continuous, reliable price feeds, and safeguards against single point of failure.\\n\\n3. Keys should be properly secured, are rotated regularly and have some level of decentralization. Adopt a **zero-trust** model. \\n\\n4. For projects utilizing lending protocols:\\n    * When deploying a new market (especially for Compound / Aave v2 forks), ensure that it is first **initialized with 0 Collateral Factor** and **deploy with small deposit to lock dead shares**.\\n    * Disallow deposits when the pool price is out of the base range of liquidity.\\n    * Increase precision on price change thresholds and deposit ratios.\\n    * For those allowing single-sided pool deposits, add a conditional statement to **prevent deposits of any ratio of assets** so long as vault is single-sided.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

The cross-chain bridge is a core component of Web3 infrastructure. For users, the cross-chain bridge can facilitate the seamless movement of tokens and messages between chains. Undeniably, while cross-chain bridges are vital for unleashing exponential innovation in Web3, they simultaneously open up potential avenues for exploitation by malicious entities. Bridges have become a new target for cryptocurrency crime. Vulnerabilities in these bridges are under attack, and hacking incidents are becoming increasingly notable.\\n\\nTo ensure the safety of users on the BNB chain, we have conducted security scans on 37 active bridge projects on the BNB chain. The scans mainly focus on two aspects:\\n1. The degree of centralization in the privileged roles of the project.\\n2. The open-source status of the project\'s smart contracts.\\n\\n\\n#### 1.Degree of Centralization in the Project\u2019s Privileged Roles\\n\\nThe main focus here is on whether privileged role management follows good security practices. The examination includes whether a privileged role is an EOA (Externally Owned Account). When an EOA is used in a privileged role, it exposes an attack surface. If the corresponding private key is exposed, the attacker may gain control over the privileged functions, endangering the project\'s economic ecosystem and user funds. Therefore, it is generally considered a better practice with a higher degree of decentralization to use multi-signature wallets, MPC (multi-party computation), or time lock contracts as privileged addresses. Using an EOA as a privileged role in a smart contract signifies a higher degree of centralization in the project. \\nThe assessment also checks whether the threshold or other parameters for privileged roles that have already used multi-signature wallets are set reasonably. If the threshold is not set properly, the multi-signature wallet cannot reduce the degree of centralization and still carries a centralization risk.\\n\\nIn the real world, notable cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities due to poor security practices for privileged roles are common:\\n\\n- Harmony Bridge (June 2022) - Two out of five private keys required to promote, approve, and execute transactions on the Harmony Bridge multi-signature were exposed. Here, the mult-sig wallet threshold is less than 51%, which is relatively low.\\n- Multichain Bridge Hack (July 2023) - The bridge\'s private key was exposed, leading to unauthorized withdrawals, all under the control of the Multichain CEO.\\n- QANplatform (October 2022) - The cross-chain bridge project was attacked, suspected to be due to a private key leak. It resulted in a loss of approximately $1.9 million, causing the price of the QANX token to plummet.\\n\\nCentralized bridge projects are not only vulnerable to attacks but also enable centralized participants to unilaterally control all funds. Decentralized privileged roles help mitigate centralization risks by requiring any potential attacker (including the bridge operator) to compromise the private keys of multiple independent entities to carry out any malicious activity, thus serving as an effective form of security.\\n\\n#### 2. The Open-Source Status of the Project\'s Smart Contracts\\n\\nThis scan primarily focuses on the open-source nature of a project\'s smart contracts. \\n\\nSince the principal function of cross-chain bridges is the transfer of value from one blockchain to another, all cross-chain protocols necessarily involve smart contracts. In most cross-chain use case scenarios, smart contracts across multiple chains are employed to facilitate functions like token minting, burning, locking, or unlocking \u2013 all crucial to efficient cross-chain movement.\\n\\nSmart contracts function as both a safeguard against vulnerabilities and a potential technical risk in the event of flawed implementation. Usually, smart contracts provide a valuable mechanism for cross-chain bridges to perform integral security checks, such as ensuring the amount a user withdraws doesn\'t exceed their deposits and enforcing rate limitations. On the other hand, poorly written, or unaudited smart contract code can have a substantially adverse effect: vulnerabilities within the smart contract code can be exploited by malicious hackers, who could potentially steal massive volumes of data from the cross-chain bridge.\\n\\nIf a cross-chain bridge smart contract on a blockchain explorer is closed source, users would not be able to understand the cross-chain logic by examining the smart contract. Similarly, it would be more difficult for users to judge the quality of the code or identify potential vulnerabilities within the smart contract. Even worse, nefarious project parties may potentially create backdoor functions within closed-source bridge smart contracts, which could lead to user funds becoming irretrievably locked. Using or approving unverified smart contracts inherently exposes users to significant financial risk.\\n\\nContrary to what some project teams may believe, failing to open-source project contracts does not necessarily prevent potential hacker attacks. In truth, experienced hackers can still make attempts on closed source project smart contracts, which impedes normal user interaction and breeds mistrust. Open-sourcing contract code not only promotes project transparency, but also helps prevent the inclusion of malicious code, ultimately fostering increased user trust. Hence, open-sourcing smart contracts is often considered to be best practice in the industry.\\n\\n\\n### Security Check Results\\n\\nThe scan results show:\\n- Out of 37 projects, 12 (32%) were found to have no apparent security risks in these two aspects;\\n- 15 (41%) out of 37 projects had issues of privileged roles centralization; 9 (24%) out of 37 projects had issues related to closed-source smart contracts.\\n- 5 (13%) projects had security issues in both aspects;\\n- The remaining 6 (16%) projects are not applicable to our scanning. 2 of the projects do not use smart contracts, instead they use Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) to transfer tokens on the chain combined with off-chain programs for cross-chain transfers. The other four projects did not develop their own cross-chain bridges, they simply provide routing selection for multiple cross-chain bridges, so our scanning doesn\'t hold much significance for these types of bridge aggregators.\\n\\n![IMG-1](./1.png)\\n\\n\\nWe found a total of 239 issues with the centralization of privileged roles and 67 issues with closed-source smart contracts.\\n\\nWe have identified the below types of risks, which include:\\n\\n1. In some bridge projects, closed-source smart contracts exist on BSCSCAN.\\n2. In some bridge projects, the smart contracts have applied the proxy pattern. While their proxy contracts are open-source, the corresponding logic contracts are closed-source.\\n3. In some bridge projects, closed-source smart contracts are used as privileged roles in certain smart contracts.\\n4. In some bridge projects, Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are used as key privileged roles in smart contracts, possessing various privileged functions.\\n5. In some bridge projects, although multi-signature wallets have been used as privileged roles in smart contracts, the multi-signature wallets have set unreasonable/low thresholds (<51%).\\n6. In some bridge projects, despite the use of multi-signature wallets as privileged roles in smart contracts, the number of owners set for the multi-signature wallet is unreasonable, such as only consisting of one owner. This essentially means that the degree of centralization is equivalent to that of an EOA.\\n\\nThrough our communication and initiatives, thus far, at least four project teams have completely or partially addressed the existing issues. Therefore, currently, there are 16 projects that have implemented good security practices in these two respects. We are still actively communicating with the remaining projects.\\n\\nIn general, nearly 50% of the cross-chain bridge projects on the BSC chain currently have a good degree of on-chain code openness and a high level of decentralization of privileged roles. In the remaining projects, most project teams have actively responded to our scanning results, showing a willingness to continuously optimize and improve in these two aspects, and are already taking steps to do so. Therefore, the security situation of bridge projects on the BSC chain is quite optimistic. Comparatively speaking, in many other blockchains, the BSC ecosystem has a relatively high overall security for its bridges.\\n\\n\\n### Best Practice Recommendations\\n\\n#### Best Practices for Addressing Centralization in Privileged Roles  \\nDecentralization is critical for providing security against single points of failure. We recommend solutions such as multi-signature wallets, time-lock contracts, and MPC wallets for use as privileged roles in smart contracts to reduce the level of centralization. \\n\\n- Multi-signature is abbreviated as multisig and requires multiple private key holders to sign a transaction, usually used to prevent one party from controlling the wallet.  \\n- A time-lock can lock certain functions of a smart contract for a specified period. It can significantly improve the security of smart contracts. For example, consider a scenario where a hacker has compromised a bridge project\'s multi-signature wallet and is preparing to withdraw money from the vault, but the vault contract has a two-day lock period. Thus, from the initiation of the withdrawal transaction to the actual withdrawal of funds, the attacker will need to abide by this two-day lock period. During this period, the project team can find countermeasures, and investors can sell out their tokens preemptively to reduce losses.\\n- MPC wallets are a subset of crypto wallets created using multi-party computation methods. They allow multiple users to create a joint wallet to store digital assets without any single point of failure. In this way, MPC wallets can ensure safety and mitigate risks, because compromising the system requires substantial effort from multiple parties. \\n\\nWe suggest combining one or more of the above solutions as privileged roles. However, please note that whether it is a multisig wallet, a timelock contract, or an MPC wallet, reasonable parameter settings must be applied in order to truly play a role and reduce the level of centralization.\\n\\n- The popular/industry standard interface currently employed for multi-signature wallets is [GnosisSafe](https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/smart-wallet-migration-guide/). When using a multi-signature wallet, it\'s important to ensure a reasonable threshold is applied. The appropriate threshold for a multi-sig wallet should depend on the number of share owners and their level of trust, and it can vary based on various practical situations. There\'s always a balance between absolute security and convenience. If you set an overly high signature requirement, wallet operation can become overly complex and cumbersome. On the other hand, setting too low of a signature requirement may invite risks of wallet misappropriation.\\nCommon settings include a 2-3-4 mode (a 3-person wallet requiring 2 signatures or a 4-person wallet requiring 3 signatures), which can ensure that, in the case of a participant\'s private key being stolen or the participant being inaccessible, others can continue to operate the wallet without reducing the wallet\'s financial security. Generally speaking, the threshold should not be lower than 51% of the total number of owners, but the total number of owners should not be less than 2.\\n\\n- Determining a reasonable lock time for a time lock contract depends on several factors, such as the specific needs of the project, the level of risk tolerance, and functionality requirements.\\nHowever, it\'s important to remember that the right lock time for a specific project may vary. For high-risk operations or projects in volatile markets, longer lock times may be necessary. Conversely, for lower-risk operations or stable markets, a shorter lock time might suffice. If the lock time is too short, say a few minutes, the project team may not have enough time to take any action, and then this locking procedure would be essentially in vain.\\nTypically, the length of lock time chosen should provide sufficient time for the contract\'s stakeholders to react to changes in the contract. Popular choices are often between 24 to 72 hours for many DeFi projects, as this provides an acceptable trade-off between security and operational efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Best Practices for Smart Contract Codes\\n\\nWhen using cross-chain protocols, risks associated with smart contracts are practical. The safest cross-chain bridges continuously test their codebases through private and competitive audits, along with various internal security tests such as fuzzing, static analysis, formal verification, symbolic execution, etc.\\n\\nAssessing the times of a codebase has been audited and by whom can serve as a reliable signal that the cross-chain bridge in use has protection against technical attacks. Additionally, layered security measures (like enabling emergency pauses and updates, and implementing rate limits) can mitigate the impact of any smart contract errors. \\n\\nWith all these measures in place, open-source code benefits the project by enhancing transparency and boosting user trust. Typically, closed-source project contracts imply potential risks or even hidden malicious code, backdoor functions, and a risk of rug pulling.\\n\\nIt\'s best to open source all contracts within the project ecosystem. This is to ensure transparency for users and to allow code auditors/white hats to verify the security of the code.\\n\\nAn often overlooked case of an unverified contract is when a smart contract uses a proxy pattern. A proxy contract is a contract which delegates calls to another contract. To interact with the actual(logic) contract users have to go through the proxy, and the proxy knows which contract to delegate the call to (the logic).\\nA proxy pattern is often used when project parities want upgradability for their contracts. This way the proxy contract stays immutable, but they can deploy a new logic contract behind the proxy contract - simply change the logic address inside the proxy contract. So that the proxy contract indeed delegates its functionality to the logic contract. Therefore, it\'s dangerous when only the proxy contract is verified and the logic contract isn\'t as it can\'t be guaranteed that the logic contract isn\'t malicious. As a best security practice, it\'s better to open source not only the proxy contract but also the logic contract.\\n\\nWhen the privileged roles of a smart contract are unverified contracts, the unverified contracts might hold some potential backdoors or malicious external interactions, it\'s best to open source that smart contract code of the privileged role.\\n\\nHow to open source contracts:\\n- On BNB chain: https://bscscan.com/verifyContract   \\n- On opBNB chain: https://opbnbscan.com/verifyContract  \\n\\nFurthermore, always maintain transparency with your investors - for example, create Medium articles, informing users of the addresses or updates of key contracts, etc.\\n\\n### Recommendation for users\\nBefore using a cross-chain bridge, users also need to conduct due diligence to ensure that they choose a bridge with effective security measures. Here are some key points:\\n\\n1. **Security**: Check whether the cross-chain bridge has passed multiple in-depth security audits, and whether the audit results didn\'t show any major issues. Also, consider how they have responded to and rectified any identified issues.\\n2. **Transparency**: It\'s important that the bridge protocol\'s source code is open source and easily accessible. This can help users understand how the protocol works and identify any potential issues.\\n3. **Decentralization**: If you have a certain understanding of smart contracts, you can check whether privileged roles in the smart contract use highly decentralized multi-signature wallets or time-lock contracts; and whether the threshold of the multi-signature wallet or the lock duration of the time-lock contract is rationally set.\\n4. **Community support**: An active and engaged community can help keep the bridge protocol updated, adaptable to market changes, and capable of solving any problems that may arise.\\n5. **Performance**: Observing the performance of the cross-chain bridge, including transaction speeds and costs, is also an important step. A bridge with strong performance and low cost ensures a better user experience.\\n6. **User Experience**: User experience is another significant factor, including the usability of the interface, whether there is a comprehensive user guide, and customer support availability.\\n7. **Partnerships and ecosystem**: It\'s beneficial for users to check whether the cross-chain bridge has many partners and supports many chains, to assess the extent and maturity of its ecosystem.\\n\\nFor cross-chain investments, due diligence is essential. You should look at official documents, white papers, security audit reports, consider community reviews, listen to expert opinions, and if possible, test their services. Find out more about it from forums, communities, or Q&A websites, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation from all aspects. Don\'t lightly believe in unverified information.\\n\\n\\n### Glossary\\n\\n- **EOA**: Externally Owned Accounts are accounts that are controlled by a private key and have no coding associated with them. If you hold the private key associated with an EOA, you can send coins and messages from it. (E.g a Metamask account).\\n\\n- **Rugpull**: A rugpull in the crypto industry is when a development team suddenly abandons a project and sells or removes all its liquidity. The name comes from the phrase to pull the rug out from under (someone), meaning to withdraw support unexpectedly.\\n\\n- **Privileged Role**: In smart contracts, \\"privileged roles\\" often refer to certain roles or accounts within the contract that have special permissions. These accounts have the authority to perform actions that regular users cannot execute in the contract. For example, privileged roles might be able to change contract parameters, upgrade the contract, or pause the contract in emergency situations.\\nWhen designing and deploying smart contracts, these privileged roles should be managed and controlled very carefully, as they have potential risks that may be misused or abused. For instance, if a bad actor gets control of a privileged role, they might have the ability to cause abnormal contract behavior or make destructive operations, such as stealing assets stored in the contract.\\nSometimes, privileged roles in a smart contract may be assigned to a multi-signature wallet, controlled collectively by multiple entities, increasing complexity and security.\\n\\n- **Multi-Sig Wallet**: A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet is a type of digital wallet that requires approval from multiple parties to authorize a cryptocurrency transaction. This type of wallet is designed to provide increased security, as it minimizes the risk of single-point failures or attacks. The \'multi-signature\' aspect refers to the multiple cryptographic keys involved: each co-owner of the wallet has a unique key, and a preset number (the \'threshold\') of these keys must be used in concert to authorize a transaction.\\n\\n- **MPC(Multi-Party Computation)**: A Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet utilizes multi-party computation technology, in which each party holds a piece of the private key, and computations are collaboratively concluded without revealing individual inputs. This introduces a new level of security as no single party has access to the entire private key, and transactions require authorization from multiple parties, making it extremely difficult for attackers. MPC is used in various applications such as privacy-preserving data analytics, secure voting, secret sharing, etc., including enhancing the security of crypto wallets and transactions. \\nCompared to multi-signature wallets, the method provided by MPC for ensuring security is different; an MPC wallet offers security through private key sharing without needing to execute a multi-party transaction on the blockchain, while multi-signature wallets offer security by approving transactions with multiple keys executed on the blockchain (leading to typically higher gas fees).\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"hashdit-snaps-guide","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/hashdit-snaps-guide","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-15/2024-05-15.md","title":"Getting Started with HashDit Snaps - A Step-by-Step Guide","description":"Getting Started with HashDit Snaps: A Step-by-Step Guide","date":"2024-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"API","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"Integration","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/integration"},{"label":"2024","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2024"}],"readingTime":4.615,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hashdit-snaps-guide","title":"Getting Started with HashDit Snaps - A Step-by-Step Guide","authors":["Sebastian"],"tags":["API","Integration","2024"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Security Scan Summary Report for Cross-Chain Bridges on the BNB Chain","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/bridge-scan-report"},"nextItem":{"title":"Monthly Incident Sharing - April 2024","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/monthly-incident-sharing-apr-2024"}},"content":"<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Getting Started with HashDit Snaps: A Step-by-Step Guide\\n\\n### Introduction\\nMeet HashDit Snaps, a revolutionary MetaMask extension designed to dramatically boost your security when interacting with smart contracts. \\nHashDit snap aims to protect users by screening transactions before they are executed through transaction insights. This include warnings against interactions with:\\n* Ponzi Schemes\\n* Risky Smart Contract Interactions\\n* Phishing Websites and Addresses\\n* Scam Websites and Addresses\\n\\nHashDit snap also provides clear details about the function and arguments invoked during a smart contract interaction.\\n\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\n**Installing MetaMask**\\n\\nAs a pre-requisite, MetaMask must be installed on your browser before installing HashDit Snaps. \\n\\n<u> Metamask Installation Link </u>\\n\\nMetaMask Snaps is currently only supported on the browser version, and not the mobile version.\\n\\nInstalling The Snap\\nOn the HashDit Snap website, start the installation process by clicking the Add to MetaMask button.\\n\\n**Installing The Snap**\\n\\nOn the HashDit Snap website, start the installation process by clicking the **Add to MetaMask** button.\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-05-15-images/1.png)\\n\\n**Permissions**\\nContinue through the install and accept the requested permissions. The requested permissions are required to allow HashDit Snap to work properly.\\n\\n* Access the internet: Allow HashDit Snap to access the internet. This is used to both send and receive data with the HashDit API.\\n* Access the Ethereum provider: Allow HashDit Snap to communicate with MetaMask directly, in order for it to read data from the blockchain and suggest messages and transactions.\\n* Allow websites to communicate directly with HashDit Security: Allow websites to send messages to HashDit Security and receive a response from HashDit Security.\\n* Fetch and display transaction insights:  Allow HashDit Snap to decode transactions and show insights within the MetaMask UI. This is used for all the security features.\\n* See the origins of websites that suggest transactions: Allow HashDit Security to see the origin (URL) of websites that suggest transactions. This is used by the URL screening feature.\\n* Store and manage its data on your device: Allow HashDit Security to store, update, and retrieve data securely with encryption. Other snaps cannot access this information. The only data stored is the signed hash of the security message (see below). \\n\\nThe HashDit snap does not have access to the user\'s private keys. Furthermore, the only transaction initiated by the Snap is a signature request dispatched during installation.\\n\\n**Signature Request**\\n\\nUpon completion of the installation process, the user will be prompted to sign a security message. Note that this is only used to authenticate the HashDit API. Rejecting the signature request will **prevent** HashDit\'s features from working. \\n\\n![IMG-2](./2024-05-15-images/2.png)\\n\\nIf the signature request is rejected, it can be re-prompted by just reinstalling the snap.\\n\\nIf you attempt to use HashDit snap without signing the security message, an error screen will be displayed.\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-05-15-images/3.png)\\n\\nReinstalling the snap will resolve this issue.\\n\\n**Reinstalling The Snap**\\n\\nTo update the snap or re-sign the signature request, users simply need to click the \'Reconnect\' button, which triggers a new installation prompt.\\n\\n![IMG-4](./2024-05-15-images/4.png)\\n\\n### How To Use HashDit Snap\\n\\nUsing HashDit Snap is simple!\\nOnce the HashDit Snap is installed, the security features are entirely automatic. The HashDit Snap will provide transaction insights before a transaction is executed by a user. In the transaction screen, a user can switch to the **HashDit Security tab** to view the risks involved with their transaction.\\n\\n![IMG-5](./2024-05-15-images/5.png)\\n\\nThe features of HashDit Snap are currently supported on the **Binance Smart Chain Mainnet** and **Ethereum Mainnet**. Other networks will only support URL screening.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n**Transaction Screening and Destination Screening**\\n\\n**Transaction Screening**\\n\\nThe **Transaction Screening** insight offers a risk assessment before interacting with a smart contract. This assessment provides users with three values that shed light on potential risks associated with their transaction:\\n**Overall Risk** - The overall risk level of the transaction, which can be one of three levels\\n\xb7\\tLow Risk\\n\xb7\\tMedium Risk \\n\xb7\\tHigh Risk\\n**Risk Overview** - The recommended action\\n**Risk Details** - Details explaining the output of the overall risk\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-05-15-images/6.png)\\n\\n**Destination Screening**\\n\\nThe **Destination Screening** insight scans a transaction\'s destination address against HashDit\'s database of blacklisted and whitelisted addresses. This database encompasses known scamming, phishing, and trusted addresses. This assessment provides users with three values that shed light on potential risks of interaction:\\n\\n**Overall Risk** - The overall risk level of the transaction can be one of three levels\\n\xb7\\tLow Risk\\n\xb7\\tMedium Risk \\n\xb7\\tHigh Risk\\n**Risk Overview** - The recommended action\\n**Risk Details** - Details explaining the output of the overall risk\\n\\n![IMG-7](./2024-05-15-images/7.png)\\n\\n**URL Screening**\\n\\nThe URL Screening insight scans the website origin of the transaction and compares it against HashDit\'s database of whitelisted and blacklisted URLs. Our database includes sites flagged as scams, deemed high-risk, and whitelisted.

For this Apr 2024 edition, the total losses mounted up to $2.7 million, showing a 54% decrease compared to April 2023. \\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n## Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n### XBridge - $1.03m - Wrong Proxy Upgrade\\n\\nXBridge is a Bridge / Cross-Chain protocol that allows users to bridge funds from one chain to another. In this attack, a vulnerable logic contract was introduced in a proxy contract upgrade, allowing the attacker to drain 466,490,205 STC tokens, 511,424,527 SRLTY tokens and 11,165,018 Mazi tokens, amounting to ~$1.03m. Interestingly, the attacker did not liquidate all tokens, and only swapped ~$192k to BNB and deposited it into Tornado Cash, leaving some tokens in his wallet.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The listToken function in the target contract does not verify msg.sender and _tokenOwner. Essentially, as long as _baseToken==_correspondingToken, the attacker can set the key variable _tokenOwner to msg.sender which is himself, and subsequently call withdrawTokens to extract the baseToken funds directly.\\n\\nThe upgrade introduced a wrong mapping _tokenOwner instead of using TokenOwner (which was correctly set up in the old logic contract), anyone can thus assume _tokenOwner and withdraw tokens.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Bug introduced in Upgrade tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x26b1c65526a0d932c1e5589e1ec31341cf918e77247ef49d3036810c0cbb09ad)\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcf8aa3b9dfcf9250a5da5e9571f98374f1d649024a81b8d5f7da2f7d92f313f9)\\n\\n \\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-05-14-images/1.png)\\n\\n### FinanceChainge - $710k - Lack of Validation\\n\\nFinanceChainge is a DeFi protocol, which is known as a liquid cross-chain aggregator. In this attack, the hackers exploited the swap function with a malicious payload. The hack amount is ~ $710k. Interestingly, the sole victim is 0x8a4aa176007196d48d39c89402d3753c39ae64c1, which is linked to the project team and hence likely funds belonging to the project.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The swap() function had a bug which allowed hackers to exploit users\u2019 allowance given to this victim contract.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd348b5fc00b26fc1457b70d02f9cb5e5a66a564cc4eba2136a473866a47dac08)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x051276afa96f2a2bd2ac224339793d82f6076f76ffa8d1b9e6febd49a4ec11b2)\\n\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2024-05-14-images/2.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### OpenLeverage - $226k - Internal accounting\\n\\nOpenLeverage is a DeFi protocol which operates as a DEX, allowing users to swap tokens. In this rather complicated attack, the attacker was able to compromise the OpenLev contract on BSC. The exploit consisted of a sequence of arbitrary external calls, taking advantage of inconsistency in the accounting for borrowers.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The attack occurred due to a discrepancy in the accounting process, which comprised two separate transactions. \\n\\nFirstly, the attacker set up a \\"margin position\\" in the OpenLevV1 contract using the marginTrade function. This function call permitted an additional position creation with minimal collateral through an untrusted external call to the OpBorrowing contract. This position was ultimately liquidated. \\n\\nHowever, both OpenLevV1 and OpBorrowing contracts use the LToken contract for their transactions. Consequently, the debt of the margin position was unintentionally cleared in the liquidation process. \\n\\nIn the second transaction, the attacker exploited this situation. They used the payoffTrade function, bypassing the health check, and drained all the collateral from the margin positions.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf08b6d36dc6f650c030344b6307ae94528f77a01db11d1284ed966e7e44337d3)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0434bf08a63d70b84fad033d38d8b645498016b3931af4d13f6c11e86848876b )\\n\\n\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-05-14-images/3.png)\\n![IMG-4](./2024-05-14-images/4.png)\\n\\n### NGFS - $190k - Lack of Validation\\n\\nNGFS is a DeFi token on BSC. In this attack, the attacker was able to manipulate his own token balance due to a lack of validation for a privileged function. As such, he could simply increase his balance and dump the tokens on the open market.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The function delegateCallReserves() can be called only once, and is supposed to be set up during the initialization phase, however it was left untouched. As such, anyone could assume _uniswapV2Proxy position and then call the setProxySync() method to set an arbitrary _uniswapV2Library. Lastly, within the reserveMultiSync() function, the attacker could set a large balance for himself since he has _uniswapV2Library privilege.\\n\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8ff764dde572928c353716358e271638fa05af54be69f043df72ad9ad054de25)\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-5](./2024-05-14-images/5.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### ATM - $180k - Price Manipulation\\n\\nATM is a DeFi token on BSC. In this attack, the attacker was able to make use of the funds in the ATM contract to add liquidity to the pool. At the same time, he could invoke the skim function to drain excess funds from the pair.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The _transfer routine can be exploited by directly transferring funds to the pair contract. This triggers the distributeCurrency function, adding liquidity from the perspective of the ATM contract. The attacker could then profit by simply calling skim on the pair.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x458ea2d7e6c5953b0d927aabc1c6a144df276d6ffa55b236087763396ee57067)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xee10553c26742bec9a4761fd717642d19012bab1704cbced048425070ee21a8a )\\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-05-14-images/6.png)\\n\\n\\n## Key lessons for developers\\n\\n\\n1. Input validation is a crucial process - it\'s essential to verify all potential user inputs, especially when these inputs affect changes to the state of the system. This holds particularly true in the below scenarios:\\n\\n    * **Calldata Parameters:** Given that attackers have the ability to craft any data, extra validation steps must be in place for calldata parameters.\\n\\n    * **User Approvals:** During the process where the protocol contract manages users\' approvals, meticulous input checks are paramount to prevent potential malicious activities.\\n\\n2. To guard against price manipulation, it\'s essential to ensure that updated prices cannot be influenced to reflect unexpected values. Oracles, both on-chain and off-chain types, can be employed by developers. Here\'s how:\\n\\n    * **Set Boundaries:** Implementing limits can block prices from being abruptly manipulated to an impossible value, regardless of the oracle type in use.\\n\\n    * **Fallback Oracle:** Integrate a secondary oracle as a fallback measure. This ensures that if the initial oracle fails, there is a backup in place to verify the consistency of prices. By doing so, it ensures continuous, reliable price feeds, and safeguards against single point of failure.\\n\\n3. Upgrading proxy code should be taken very seriously and should require several checks such as:\\n\\n    * **Thorough Testing**: Conduct rigorous testing before deploying any updates to ensure that the changes will not disrupt existing functionalities or introduce new vulnerabilities.\\n\\n    * **Code Audits**: Always get your code audited by a third party. It\'s crucial to have another set of eyes inspect your code, as they may spot issues that you\'ve overlooked.\\n\\n    * **Pause Functionality**: Make sure that your contract has a \'pause\' functionality. In case something goes wrong, this function allows halting the operations until the issue is fixed.\\n\\n4. Addressing internal accounting errors and effectively handling external arbitrary calls are critical for crypto developers, especially for lending projects which involve complex financial transactions. Here are some recommendations:\\n\\n    * **Sequencing Transactions**: Consider sequencing transactions appropriately. Generally, it\'s safer to make state changes before conducting external calls.\\n\\n    * **External Calls**: Be extremely careful while interacting with third-party contracts. They should be treated as potentially malicious. Avoid state changes after making a call to an external contract.\\n\\n    * **Precise Accounting**: Keep accurate and precise accounting to make sure all balances tally at the end of each operation. This is primarily to ensure that no tokens are lost or mistakenly created during transactions.\\n\\n    * **Debt and Collateral Management**: Carefully track and manage computational handling of debt and collateral. Errors in management or calculation can lead to vulnerabilities such as unforeseen liquidations or insolvency.\\n\\n    * **Limit Permissions**: Limit the permissions of the contract that makes external calls to only what\'s necessary to reduce your contract\'s attack surface.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

For this Mar 2024 edition, the total losses mounted up to $146 million, showing a 50% decrease compared to March 2023. \\n\\nOf which, they are split across 2 sections: DApps ($114m) and Phishing ($32m).\\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n## Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n### Munchables - $62.5m - Insider Attack\\n\\nMunchables is a GameFi and NFT protocol. In this attack, it was confirmed to be an Insider Attack where a rogue employee was malicious, gaining access to a privileged account. After malicious logic was introduced in a proxy contract upgrade, 62M funds were transferred out by the attacker. Thankfully, after some negotiation and investigation, the funds were eventually returned.\\n\\n**Root cause**: Malicious developer was hired and suspected to be linked to DPRK, and had bad intentions right from the start. It was found that the malicious logic was already introduced during deployment and the bad actor used manual manipulation of the getLocked storage slot to assign himself an enormous Ether balance in the contract, so that his locked amount would bypass the withdrawal checks.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://blastscan.io/tx/0x9a7e4d16ed15b0367b8ad677eaf1db6a2a54663610696d69e1b4aa1a08f55c95)\\n\\n[Malicious contract upgrade](https://blastscan.io/tx/0xea1d9c0d8de4280b538b6fe6dbc3636602075184651dfeb837cb03f8a19ffc4f)\\n\\n**Code snippet**:\\n\\nUnverified contract\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-04-09-images/1.png)\\n![IMG-2](./2024-04-09-images/2.png)\\n\\n\\n### PrismaFi - $12m - Lack of Validation\\n\\nPrismaFi is a DeFi protocol, which is known as a non-custodial and decentralized Ethereum LST & LRT backed stablecoins. In this attack, the hackers bypassed the migrate function and called the flash loan directly with carefully crafted input data.\\n\\nThe flash loan\'s callback function, onFlashloan(), was called. The lack of proper checks allowed the hackers to close a trove owner\'s Trove and immediately reopen it within the same TroveManager. The transaction caused the owner\'s position to be closed and reopened, resulting in the trove owner having a new position with the same debt but less collateral and the difference in collateral sitting in the zap contract.\\n\\nThe hackers then opened a new Trove and used the MigrateTroveZap contract to migrate it, effectively using the remaining collateral for their own Trove.\\nFinally, the hackers closed their Trove and took the profits.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The root cause of the vulnerability was twofold:\\n\\n1. By directly calling the onFlashloan() function, the user could manipulate other trove managers positions.\\n2. The contract allowed for a mismatch between the collateral in the initial position and the collateral in the new position, with the difference being susceptible to being taken.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x00c503b595946bccaea3d58025b5f9b3726177bbdc9674e634244135282116c7)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xce3cdc7c29eb7dfc565f5d99034789e80c1cd3278adafa26af6f3d21c8412c59)\\n\\n[Hack tx 3](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e38dd693ddbc2f62282932f36a4b8de75f8ea1da530532af26698b4eda9a110)\\n\\n\\n**Code snippet**:\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-04-09-images/3.png)\\n\\n### WooFi - $8.7m - Price Manipulation\\n\\nWooFi is a DeFi protocol which operates as a DEX, allowing users to swap tokens. In this attack, the attacker was able to compromise the WooPPV2 contract on Arbitrum. The exploit consisted of a sequence of flash loans that took advantage of low liquidity to manipulate the price of WOO in order to repay the flash loans at a cheaper price.\\n\\n**Root cause**: There were 2 configuration issues. \\n1. A previously unidentified error resulted in the price being adjusted far outside of the expected range ($0.00000009) \\n2. The fallback check, normally executed against Chain Link, didn\u2019t cover the WOO token price.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx 1](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x40e1b8c78083fc666cb7598efcecd0ae0af313fc41441386e4db716c2808ce07)\\n\\n[Hack tx 2](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe80a16678b5008d5be1484ec6e9e77dc6307632030553405863ffb38c1f94266)\\n\\n\\n**Code snippet**:\\n\\n![IMG-4](./2024-04-09-images/4.png)\\n![IMG-5](./2024-04-09-images/5.png)\\n\\n\\n### SSS_HQ - $4.8m - Function wrongly implemented\\n\\nSSS_HQ or Super Sushi Samurai is a GameFi platform on Blast chain. In this attack, thankfully a White Hat was able to spot the bug before any malicious actor, where he increased his own balance by repeatedly transferring to himself. He subsequently swapped these tokens in the liquidity pool and protected the liquidity of ~$4.8m.\\n\\n**Root cause**: The tax transfer logic is wrongly implemented in the _update method of the SSS.sol code. The _balances[to] value is incremented before the _balances[from] value is updated (done within the _postCheck method), seen in the first picture. As such, the balance of the to address uses the stale value i.e original balance, seen in the second picture. This is summed with the amount variable, stored in the toBalance variable and subsequently overwriting the _balances[from] in the last statement, almost doubling the sender\u2019s balance.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[White-hat Hack tx](https://blastscan.io/tx/0x62e6b906bb5aafdc57c72cd13e20a18d2de3a4a757cd2f24fde6003ce5c9f2c6)\\n\\n**Code snippet**:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-04-09-images/6.png)\\n![IMG-7](./2024-04-09-images/7.png)\\n\\n\\n### Unizen - $2.1m - Lack of Validation\\n\\nUnizen is a DeFi protocol which operates as a DEX across multiple chains. In this instance, the attack happened on Ethereum, just 5 hours after the victim proxy was upgraded to a vulnerable logic contract. The vulnerable contract introduced a function 0x1ef29a02 which allowed arbitrary calldata to be sent. \\n\\n**Root cause**: Lack of validation in a Swap related function (which allowed arbitrary transferFrom calls, specifying the From, To and Amount parameters). As such, victims that have approved their funds to this contract will be affected.\\n\\n**Onchain information**:\\n\\n[Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc12a4155c2c90707138e4aef8883c8f724371145823e2f661f19b93e5b3a9d6e)\\n\\n**Code snippet**:\\nUnverified contract\\n\\n\\n![IMG-8](./2024-04-09-images/8.png)\\n![IMG-9](./2024-04-09-images/9.png)\\n![IMG-10](./2024-04-09-images/10.png)\\n\\n\\n## Key lessons for developers\\n\\n1. In light of potential insider compromises, it\'s crucial to apply thorough background checks for new employees. Specifically, keep an eye out for potential red flags including:\\n\\n    * **Preference for certain platforms:** Malicious developers seem to favor using Github, often impersonating user profiles such as SuperTalentedDev726 or CryptoKnight415.\\n\\n    * **Use of numbers:** Both email addresses and Github usernames often contain numerical sequences. It\'s suspected they use this as a method for tracking the identities they impersonate.\\n\\n    * **Asian identities:** There\'s a tendency toward choosing Japanese (and possibly Korean) identities, often claiming prior education in Japan.\\n\\n    * **Prominent educational background:** The falsified credentials often include elite universities in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Such institutions may include Singapore State University, Nanyang Technological University, University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\\n\\n    * **Codebase theft:** While not always the case, these imposters often steal existing projects from GitHub and recondition the commit messages to reflect their assumed usernames.\\n\\n    * **Multiple applications:** They tend to apply repeatedly for the same job, resorting to multiple email addresses for their submissions.\\n\\n    * **Premature expertise:** They often claim experience in Solidity/EVM too early (such as in 2015), which is an unlikely scenario giving the nascent state of blockchain technology at the time.\\n\\n2. Input validation is a crucial process - it\'s essential to verify all potential user inputs, especially when these inputs affect changes to the state of the system. This holds particularly true in the below scenarios:\\n\\n    * **Calldata Parameters:** Given that attackers have the ability to craft any data, extra validation steps must be in place for calldata parameters.\\n\\n    * **User Approvals:** During the process where the protocol contract manages users\' approvals, meticulous input checks are paramount to prevent potential malicious activities.\\n\\n3. To guard against price manipulation, it\'s essential to ensure that updated prices cannot be influenced to reflect unexpected values. Oracles, both on-chain and off-chain types, can be employed by developers. Here\'s how:\\n\\n    * **Set Boundaries:** Implementing limits can block prices from being abruptly manipulated to an impossible value, regardless of the oracle type in use.\\n\\n    * **Fallback Oracle:** Integrate a secondary oracle as a fallback measure. This ensures that if the initial oracle fails, there is a backup in place to verify the consistency of prices. By doing so, it ensures continuous, reliable price feeds, and safeguards against single point of failure.\\n\\n4. Ensuring that the deployed function aligns with the intended objective is a critical requirement, especially for high-stakes operations such as accounting. This assurance can be achieved through:\\n\\n    * **Thorough Testing:** Execute comprehensive fuzz testing and edge case analysis. This doesn\'t solely ensure correct function logic, it also helps to identify potential flaws and security vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked.\\n\\n    * **Use Trusted Templates:** Consider using trusted codebases, such as Openzeppelin, as a foundation for your code. These established libraries have been vetted extensively by the developer community, reducing the likelihood of introduction of unexpected bugs or issues.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

From the fun frenzy around Doge coins, Cat coins, Pepe coins, to the latest hype surrounding Solana memes, they\'ve become a phenomenon that\u2019s difficult to ignore. Their promise of potentially delivering exponential returns attracts many users. But with great rewards come great risks.\\n\\nIn the decentralized web3 world, fraud such as honeypot scams and rugpull schemes are unfortunately common. These deceptive strategies often use innocuous meme tokens as bait, exploiting the pseudonymous nature of addresses to deceive unsuspecting investors. \\n\\nAt HashDit, we\'re committed to maximizing user security by providing countermeasures to these issues. Our aim is to enable more users to understand the potential risks associated with tokens they encounter, especially as trading becomes increasingly accessible with the surge of channels, with Telegram bots being one good example. \\n\\nHashDit provides token scanning and threat intelligence services to platforms such as PancakeSwap and Trust Wallet, where users can make informed decisions after being notified of the risks. Platforms like DAppBay have also integrated our API, offering a scanner that users can employ to evaluate the risk associated with a token before investing in it.\\n\\nHowever, while automation can help to identify most risks, it\'s not completely foolproof. Even the most sophisticated models can have false positives. So, how can you personally ensure a meme token\'s safety before investing? Here\'s a basic checklist:\\n\\n### As a meme user investor:\\n\\n1. **Research the Token:** Start your exploration by looking into the meme token online. Rely on trustworthy sources such as the project\'s website, or reputable third-party sites like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/). This helps you glean a well-rounded view of the asset.\\n\\n2. **Verify the Contract Address:** Token replication is a common forgery tactic. To avoid falling into honeypot traps or scams, ensure that you\'re investing in the legitimate token by verifying the contract address with authentic sources like the project\u2019s website. \\n\\n3. **Investigate the Team and Developers:** Confidence in a token is often synonymous with the team behind it. Check their track record and transparency levels. Always remember, a credible team builds a credible token.\\n\\n4. **Audit Reports:** It is important to find out if professional security auditors have vetted the meme token\u2019s code. Audit reports from reliable firms can significantly mitigate the risk of scams hidden in the code.\\n\\n5. **Social Media and Community Interactions:** Stay engaged with the project\u2019s online communities on platforms like Telegram, Twitter, Discord, and so forth. Active and responsive social media channels underscore the project\'s genuine nature.\\n\\n6. **Smart Contract Checks:** Basic review of the smart contract code is strongly advised, [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/) is a good way to check this. Firstly, check if the contract code is verified or open-source. (Paste the address on BscScan. Click on Contract and then Code.)\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-04-04-images/1.png)\\n\\nIf the contract code has been verified, there should be an accompanying green tick seen.\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2024-04-04-images/2.png)\\n\\nIf the contract has not been verified, the code would not be seen and there would be no green tick.\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-04-04-images/3.png)\\n \\nIf the code is verified, users should then proceed to look for any privileged functions that the team has access to, within the \\"Search Source Code\\" box.\\n\\n![IMG-4](./2024-04-04-images/4.png)\\n\\nThe presence of these privileged functions might pose a potential security risk to investors, causing loss of funds.\\n\\nCommon privileged functions can include, but not limited to: mint(), pause(), blacklist(), whitelist(), setFee(), etc. An easy way to search through the code is to use keywords (ctrl-F) like \u201conlyOwner\u201d and \u201cauthorized\u201d. \\n\\nHowever, it is possible that the privileged role has been renounced i.e the dead address. As such, it is critical to check if the privileged role is an Externally Owned Account (EOA). To verify the ownership, click on \u201cRead Contract\u201d and search for \u201cowner\u201d.\\n\\n![IMG-5](./2024-04-04-images/5.png)\\n\\nIf the address is an EOA, you would see an \u201cAddress\u201d label beside the actual address, as seen below.\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-04-04-images/6.png)\\n\\nHowever, do take note that the address could be a \u201cDead address\u201d. A \u201cDead address\u201d in crypto terms simply means that nobody has the keys to this account and hence the tokens there would be taken out of circulation. 2 common examples are \\n[0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and [0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead](https://bscscan.com/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)\\n\\n\\nIn other circumstances, you could see another label called \u201cContract\u201d. This simply means that another smart contract has privileges over this token. \\n\\n![IMG-7](./2024-04-04-images/7.png)\\n\\nIf it was a Multi-Signature wallet, you would see a \u201cSmart Account by Safe\u201d. This is relatively more secure as multiple owners can verify transactions.\\n\\n![IMG-8](./2024-04-04-images/8.png)\\n\\nIf this label is not there, it could be a Timelock related smart contract managed by the team. In this case, users should check with the team to get more clarity. \\n\\n7. **Automated Security Scanners:** Other external tools such as GoPlus and Honeypot.is can be utilized to cross-check that the token is indeed secure. This increases confidence in the security assessing process.\\n\\n8. **Liquidity Locks:** A locked liquidity usually denotes a safer investment. You can check this on the project\'s website, as well as verify through independent tools like BscScan. Detecting a lack of liquidity lock could save you from falling for a rug pull. \\n\\nMost meme projects would inform their investors on their site that a certain percentage is burned or locked. However, to ensure that this information is accurate, you are encouraged to verify this with BscScan. You can follow the following steps:\\n\\n* After pasting the address, click on the token link under \u201cMore Info\u201d -> \u201cTOKEN TRACKER\u201d. \\n* Then, click \u201cHolders\u201d to check who are the top holders for the meme token.\\n\\n![IMG-9](./2024-04-04-images/9.png)\\n\\nSome of the positive signs to look out for amongst the top holders include the presence of Dead addresses, having its supply stored in Multi-Signature wallets or being listed on Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) like Binance. This means that some of the liquidity is locked temporarily with trustable entities or permanently with these addresses.\\n\\nAnother common strategy for meme tokens is to use a Liquidity Locker. There are 2 types here: either a 1) 3rd party Locking-as-a-Service platform or a 2) Personal locking contract deployed by the team.\\n\\nPopular 3rd party platforms include PinkSale and Unicrypt locking services. As such, their respective labels will be visible in the Holders list as seen below.  \\n\\n![IMG-10](./2024-04-04-images/10.png)\\n\\nA personal Locking contract by the team could be a smart contract with the name \u201cVesting / Locking wallet\u201d, as seen in the image below.\\n\\n![IMG-12](./2024-04-04-images/12.png)\\n\\nSimilarly, you can apply the same process to the liquidity token. Usually, this would be a PancakeSwap LP token. To get the liquidity token from the meme token, you can use another tool like dextools.io, paste the address to obtain the pair contract address.\\n\\n### As a meme project owner:\\n\\nTo launch and maintain a successful and trustworthy meme token, consider the following:\\n\\n1. **Transparency:** Keep your team identities accessible, and refrain from restricting users\' comments on community platforms like Twitter or Telegram. Posting regular updates about the project\'s progress are also key to building trust and transparency.\\n\\n2. **Credibility:** Forge partnerships with reputable projects, and aim to list your token on recognized centralized or decentralized exchanges that have established themselves as being trustworthy. These actions can help to add credibility to the meme token.\\n\\n\\n3. **Supply Locking:** Locking your token\'s supply adds an extra layer of security and stability to your project. This includes not just the token\u2019s supply, but also the liquidity on decentralized exchanges. As a guideline, the locking period should be at least 1 year. Numerous platforms offer Locking-as-a-Service, or you could opt to deploy your own locking or vesting contracts using libraries like [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, exercising awareness and caution by both users and project owners are essential for fostering growth in the dynamic world of meme tokens. By following the safety guidelines here, users can avoid potential pitfalls, and projects can increase their chance of success. \\n\\nIt is important to take note that meme tokens generally contain high risks and can have significant price fluctuations so users should be wary in terms of their risk management.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"monthly-incident-sharing-feb-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/monthly-incident-sharing-feb-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-14/2024-03-14.md","title":"Monthly Incident Sharing - February 2024","description":"Monthly Incident Sharing (Feb 2024)","date":"2024-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 14, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Feb","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/feb"},{"label":"Incidents","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/incidents"},{"label":"Sharing","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/sharing"},{"label":"2024","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2024"}],"readingTime":4.455,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"monthly-incident-sharing-feb-2024","title":"Monthly Incident Sharing - February 2024","authors":["Sebastian"],"tags":["Feb","Incidents","Sharing","2024"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Meme Education Guide","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/meme-education-guide"},"nextItem":{"title":"HashDit API Integration","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/api-integration"}},"content":"<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Monthly Incident Sharing (Feb 2024)\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nIn this monthly series, HashDit is sharing the monthly security incidents in the crypto space and what we can learn from them. For this Feb 2024 edition, the total losses mounted up to $132 million, showing a 141% increase compared to February 2023. \\n\\nOf which, they are split across 3 sections: DApps ($65m), CEXs ($62m) and Phishing ($5m).\\n\\nIn this sharing, we focus on the DApps incidents. Below are the top 5 DApps incidents that DApp Developers should pay attention to.\\n\\n### Top 5 DApps incidents\\n\\n#### PlayDapp - $30m - Private Key Compromise\\nPlayDapp is a GameFi and Web3 Service protocol. In this attack, the hacker was able to compromise the original Minter account. As such, a malicious minter account was added and he minted 200m $PLA tokens, before dumping them on the open market.\\n\\nSince then, the token transfer method has been paused and the token is planning to be migrated to a new address $PDA.\\n\\nRoot cause: The hacker was able to compromise the private key of the original Minter account. It is unclear if it was an internal or external attack.\\n\\nOnchain information:\\n\\n[Add Malicious Minter tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe834f28377b79759ac5495a91975a01e0876af9aae312228c1ac525846406170)\\n\\n[Malicious Mint tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe8be05f6a3360f63b9e78a30b4ba16ea4c7d0b530a8abf99390f1c831851fb7e)\\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-03-14-images/1.png)\\n![IMG-2](./2024-03-14-images/2.png)\\n\\n#### Ronin Network\u2019s Jihoz - $10m - Private Key Compromise\\nRonin Network is a bridge protocol allowing cross chain of funds. In this attack, Ronin Network\u2019s cofounder Jihoz had his wallet compromised. However, the attack is limited to only personal accounts, and does not affect operations of Sky Mavis and the Ronin chain.\\n\\nRoot cause: The hacker was able to compromise the private key of Jihoz\u2019s wallet. As such, his assets were stolen from there.\\n\\nOnchain information:\\n\\n- Ronin:\\n    https://app.roninchain.com/tx/0x206bc24404b66f9a4424c7515bd6da92ce95640fae66fe217784a0edd71334dd \\n    https://app.roninchain.com/tx/0x93977df7f34204a88ed12ddb591e2e58a0aad6edfd009ca6db4491e14f9f38d9 \\n    https://app.roninchain.com/tx/0x9784ad2501cff282fa98a87272a9ac4379170fb80a2da92e5c7195fa5af274f1 \\n    https://app.roninchain.com/tx/0x7fb315e8c27d78f6a3c4bd812b2afcf0b3b3e80fd36c8db3ab3d0e9dfa58c291 \\n\\n- Ethereum:\\n    https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4962a88dfd49e49d3df0f290ae7d4b73632b2afc943a7ea5c2ee45140de7ad93 \\n    https://etherscan.io/tx/0x517dac8e59ca0d5e7017323a75dd732b2d48b07c9de20c2bfcaf1cee22cd7d7b \\n    https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5cd2b28d70b79d7f1d92f7273234f2a4ce3b153731ef44dffedac425de311201 \\n    https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcdd35d3c3a1b584dfa86732a61d5f42f6c5b0c03c6805ccd97294c6f1a0163f5 \\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-3](./2024-03-14-images/3.png)\\n![IMG-4](./2024-03-14-images/4.png)\\n![IMG-5](./2024-03-14-images/5.png)\\n\\n#### Shido - $3.3m - Private Key Compromise\\nShido is a L1 blockchain protocol which combines the interoperability of Cosmos, and the development power of EVM and WASM. In this attack, the attacker was able to compromise the StakingV4Proxy owner\'s wallet on Ethereum, upgrading to a malicious logic, withdrawing $SHIDO tokens and dumping them on the open market. \\n\\nRoot cause: The hacker was able to compromise the private key of StakingV4Proxy\u2019s owner wallet. It is unclear if it was an internal or external attack.\\n\\nAfter transferring ownership to a malicious owner, he immediately upgrades the StakingV4Proxy contract with a malicious withdrawToken() function that withdraws all $SHIDO tokens from the contract.\\n\\nOnchain information:\\n\\n[StakingV4Proxy owner transfer tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaa76ea503fadddf775b1ef7f195676440fdc3ac46ab642798ab6fa7ae3aafcbe)\\n\\n[StakingV4Proxy upgrade tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5d4056cdf40d09a6715fd0f26895d0c60038899b45620f0a6a402c4cd425b672)\\n\\n[Withdraw all $SHIDO tokens tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xed3000ddd8b4feb0902107f97a91815ecee8d7ccb57de9a9dbc50a4c07593cb3)\\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-6](./2024-03-14-images/6.png)\\n![IMG-7](./2024-03-14-images/7.png)\\n\\n\\n#### Seneca - $3.1m - Lack of Validation \\nSeneca Protocol is a DeFi lending platform and stablecoin issuer. In this attack, the attacker was able to compromise approximately 1,385 PT-Kelp rsETH from a Seneca collateral pool. He subsequently swapped these tokens for approximately $3 million worth of ETH.\\n\\nRoot cause: There is a lack of validation check for the user input data in the performOperations() function. This bug allows any account to call the function while specifying OPERATION_CALL as the action to be performed, allowing an exploiter to arbitrarily invoke external calls to steal funds from approving users.\\n\\nOnchain information:\\n\\n[Hack tx on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6da8f7cb19d6e56cd9b74298677986b3b55cb9db902175c2627b7d57a85e820d) \\n\\n[Hack tx on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x5e9c14e30ff1d56da37c17d84378650881095bda2802f0a0bff90fd3a8b11e31)\\n\\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-8](./2024-03-14-images/8.png)\\n![IMG-9](./2024-03-14-images/9.png)\\n![IMG-10](./2024-03-14-images/10.png)\\n\\n\\n#### BlueberryFDN - $1.6m - Oracle Misconfiguration \\nBlueberryFDN is a DeFi protocol which allows lending and borrowing of funds across chains. In this instance, the attack was front-runned by a whitehat, c0ffeebabe.eth. The vulnerability was due to the lending contract\'s incorrect handling of price decimals. As such, the attacker was able to borrow all the liquidity of three lending pools (OHM, USDC, WBTC) with extremely low collateral, since the assets borrowed are under-estimated, due to the non-normalized price.\\n\\nRoot cause: There was an incorrect usage of the oracle because the oracle always returns prices scaled to 18 decimals, thus causing assets that have less than 18 decimals to be undervalued significantly when being borrowed. \\n\\nOn Ethereum, WETH has a decimal of 18, OHM has a decimal of 9, USDC has a decimal of 6, and WBTC has a decimal of 8. Since BlueberryProtocol\u2019s price oracle scales all token prices based on a decimal of 18, this caused the value of OHM to shrink by 1e9, USDC by 1e12, and WBTC by 1e10. As a result, the attacker managed to borrow assets worth 460 ETH by only collateralizing 1 ETH.\\n\\nOnchain information: \\n\\n[Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf0464b01d962f714eee9d4392b2494524d0e10ce3eb3723873afd1346b8b06e4 ) \\n\\nCode snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-11](./2024-03-14-images/11.png)\\n\\n### Key lessons for developers\\n\\n1. Keys should be properly secured, rotated regularly and have some level of decentralization. Adopt a **zero-trust model**. \\nConduct proper background checks for new employees in view of insider compromises.\\n\\n\\n2. Validation is important - **ensure all possible user inputs are checked for state changing** methods. This is especially true for calldata parameters where attackers can craft any data and when the protocol contract handles users\u2019 approvals.\\n\\n\\n3. Proper handling of decimals in different tokens used in the protocol is fundamental, particularly when calculating token price values. Furthermore, guaranteeing that the **price oracles used in the protocol are normalized to the expected decimals** is critical. Price oracles provide current and accurate token prices, thus any discrepancies might lead to significant errors in token pricing and overall system operations.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

In this attack, the hacker was able to compromise 1 of the bridge\u2019s vault and steal its funds. [Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8ca42941a0a2c25669267ad8d61f7f9f4118252cb502316602fe16624b80ac8)\\n\\nRoot cause: Backend compromise. The hacker was able to produce 15 correct Signer keys (v, r, s values), although the threshold needed was just 7. \\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./2024-02-08-images/1.png)\\n\\n#### Magic Internet Money (MIM) - $6.5m\\nMagic Internet Money is a DeFi protocol which allows lending and borrowing of funds. In this attack, the attacker was able to compromise 1 of the protocol\u2019s markets and steal funds. [Hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x26a83db7e28838dd9fee6fb7314ae58dcc6aee9a20bf224c386ff5e80f7e4cf2)\\n\\nRoot cause: The borrow function in CauldronV4 contracts was vulnerable to manipulation of the part parameter (the user\u2019s share of total debt) via repeatedly borrowing and repaying an asset, taking advantage of the rounding error. \\n\\nVulnerable code snippet:\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2024-02-08-images/2.png)\\n![IMG-3](./2024-02-08-images/3.png)\\n![IMG-4](./2024-02-08-images/4.png)\\n![IMG-5](./2024-02-08-images/5.png)\\n\\n#### Gamma Strategies - $4.6m\\nGamma Strategies is a DeFi protocol which allows active liquidity management and market making strategies. In this attack, the attacker was able to compromise 1 of the protocol\u2019s vaults and steal funds. [Hack tx](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x6116f311ac199d6f608c52e44c93a0e6961f10380fd379873b8bf27c92402462)\\n\\nRoot cause: The liquidity ratio checker function erroneously allowed for deposits in any ratio so long as the contents within the vault were single-sided. This allowed for a disproportionate amount of token 0 being deposited, gaining more shares than expected.

Keys should be properly secured, rotated regularly and have some level of decentralization. Adopt a **zero-trust model**. \\nConduct proper background checks for new employees in view of insider compromises.\\n\\n\\n2. Validation is important - **ensure all possible user inputs are checked for state changing** methods. This is especially true for calldata parameters where attackers can craft any data and when the protocol contract handles users\u2019 approvals.\\n\\n\\n3. Rounding in Solidity always rounds down. As such, it is important to perform multiplication before division and to round down for the user during withdrawals, and round up during deposits. Consider **increasing precision** during calculations to avoid unexpected manipulation attacks.\\n\\n    However, in the latest donation attacks for lending protocols, we see that the usual rule to favor protocol for calculations is no longer sufficient. There must be better **health checks for bad debt** as well, at the end state of a transaction.\\n\\n\\n4. For projects utilizing lending protocols:\\n    * When deploying a new market (especially for Compound / Aave v2 forks), ensure that it is first **initialized with 0 Collateral Factor** and **deploy with small deposit to lock dead shares**.\\n    * Disallow deposits when the pool price is out of the base range of liquidity.\\n    * Increase precision on price change thresholds and deposit ratios.\\n    * For those allowing single-sided pool deposits, add a conditional statement to **prevent deposits of any ratio of assets** so long as vault is single-sided.\\n\\n5. Always engage a security auditor to **review all code upgrades before they are deployed on chain**. This prevents new bugs from being introduced.\\n\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

Yet the importance of this reach brings with it a need for unyielding security. Compromised Twitter accounts - particularly those focused on crypto - pose substantial threats; their impacts can resonate deeply not just within individual digital wallets, but across the entire crypto market. \\n\\nIn this blog post, we\'re going to explore both the personal and professional implications of these security breaches, paying special attention to their effects within the crypto community. As we journey through the world of crypto Twitter, grasping the potential threats is crucial to fortifying our digital fortress and nurturing a safe, reliable space for crypto discourse.\\n\\n### Part 1: Understanding Compromised Accounts\\n\\nA compromised Twitter account means a legitimate, usually verified account, falls prey to a malicious entity. The attacker obtains control, gaining access to personal data and the power to impersonate the original account holder. In the crypto-Twitter world, this can lead to misinformation, financial manipulation or phishing attacks, posing substantial risks to the wider crypto community. \\n\\nThere are 3 main risks associated with Compromised Accounts\\n\\n1. Potential distribution of harmful links or malware. This could occur if the malicious actor uses the hijacked account to send or post dangerous links which, when clicked, could infect a user\'s device with malware. This puts the user\'s personal and potentially sensitive data at risk, as malware can be used to steal information, spy on user activity, or even hijack further accounts. \\n\\n2. Manipulate trusting followers into making detrimental financial decisions based on misleading guidance. \\n\\n3. Security breaches reflect negatively on the organization behind the account, damaging their reputation and casting doubt about their competence in protecting user information and funds. Hence, Twitter account security is crucial to maintaining credibility and safeguarding followers\' interests.\\n\\nThere have been several notable accounts (not only Crypto related) that have been compromised just in 2024 so far:\\n\\n* SEC [Ref](https://x.com/Safety/status/1744924042681897343?s=20)\\n* Mandiant [Ref](https://x.com/Mandiant/status/1745173809752330385?s=20)\\n* CoinGecko [Ref](https://x.com/SolanaFloor/status/1745153528744849494?s=20)\\n* ReStake Finance [Ref](https://x.com/cryptojohnnyfap/status/1746891037249863799?s=20)\\n* Injective [Ref](https://x.com/lowercaseboot/status/1745203058102161467?s=20)\\n* Arkham Intelligence\u2019s CEO [Ref](https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1747752146206965956?s=20)\\n\\n### Part 2: Signs of a Compromised Twitter Account\\nRecognizing the signs of a compromised Twitter account is crucial to minimize potential damage.\\n\\nSymptoms include but are not limited to:\\n\\n1. User point of view\\n\\n    1. Compromised accounts start making an unexpected tweet from their usual timeline.\\n\\n        For example, \\n\\n        ![IMG-1](./2024-01-27-images/1.png)\\n\\n        * Urgent call to action message\\n\\n        * Twitter card spoofing is a technique used by the scammers to trick users into believing they are clicking on the official site.\\n\\n        * Replies are usually turned off to prevent users from calling them out and warning others.\\n\\n    2. Making unsolicited DMs to everyday users. This will be to gain trust since it appears to be from a trusted source and can be seen from the DM recipient.\\n\\n    3. Blocking security related accounts that call them out. This is to prevent accounts with wider following from informing others.\\n\\n\\n2. Compromised account\u2019s point of view\\n\\n    1. The project party might start noticing unexpected tweets, retweets, or likes appearing on your profile\\n\\n    2. Receiving direct messages you did not send \\n\\n    3. Noticing changes to your account settings such as email, password, or linked phone number that you didn\'t make\\n\\n    4. Alerts for login attempts or successful logins from unfamiliar locations, a sudden increase in the number of unknown followers, involuntarily following new accounts\\n\\n    5. Messages from your followers about suspicious activity or spam originating from your account.\\n\\n### Part 3: How Twitter Accounts Get Compromised\\nUnderstanding how hackers compromise Twitter accounts is key to enhancing your security position.\\n\\n1. Phishing:\\n\\n    1 of the most common techniques used is through Social Engineering and Phishing. For example, if DMs are turned on and your social media presence is strong, they target you, gain your trust and subsequently ask you to click and authorize Twitter permissions through a 3rd party site. This 3rd party site will gain access to posting on your behalf, changing passwords and settings etc.\\n\\n2. SIM Swap Attacks:\\n\\n    These represent a real threat to Twitter users who\'ve linked their accounts with their mobile numbers, presenting a lucrative attack vector for bad actors. In essence, scammers manipulate this to their advantage to commandeer your account.\\n\\n3. Password Vulnerability and Lack of 2FA:\\n\\n    A negligently secure mindset lays the foundation for such attacks. Usage of weak passwords that can fall prey to brute-force attacks and absence of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) turns the account into low-hanging fruit for hackers.\\n\\n4. Consequences of Data Breaches:\\n\\n    Accounts running on the same password across multiple platforms are in jeopardy. The compromise of one account may well trigger a domino effect, subjecting various other accounts to risk too.\\n\\n5. The Risk of Malware:\\n\\n    If you\'re storing passwords unencrypted on your local desktop or making visits to dangerous websites to download potentially malicious applications, you\'re inadvertently setting the stage for hackers to access your passwords.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Part 4: How to Secure Your Twitter Account\\nUnderstanding the necessary steps to secure your Twitter account is essential to maintaining your privacy and safety online.\\n\\nTo ensure the robust security of your Twitter account, consider the following steps:\\n\\n1. Creating a strong password is one of the first and most fundamental steps towards securing your online presence. Regularly updating your password can also bolster its resilience against unauthorized access.\\n\\n    It should be at least 12 characters long and composed of varied elements including a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid including easily guessable data such as your name, birthdates, or common words. If remembering a complex password seems challenging, consider using a reliable password manager or creating a passphrase, which is a sentence-like string of words that is easy to remember and hard for hackers to crack. \\n\\n2. Switch to Non-SMS-Based 2FA: It would be best to activate a non-SMS-based two-factor authentication. Instead of SMS, consider using an authenticator app or, for maximum security, a Yubikey.\\n\\n3. Regularly Audit Third-Party App Permissions: It\'s pivotal to periodically verify third-party application permissions linked to your account and screen for any unsanctioned approvals. These could potentially be monitoring your actions. Basic guide is as follows:\\n\\n    More -> Settings and Support -> Settings and Privacy -> Security and Account access -> Apps and sessions -> Connected apps -> Delete it!\\n\\t\\n    ![IMG-2](./2024-01-27-images/2.png)\\n\\n4. Be Cautious of Suspicious Activity: Stay alert to any dubious emails, direct messages, or links from unfamiliar sources. In spite of possible impersonations, it\'s prudent not to interact with them.\\n\\n5. Use Secure and Updated Devices: It\'s crucial to access your Twitter account through secure devices that are regularly updated to keep your account safe from newly discovered threats.\\n\\n6. Continuously Review Account Access: Regular updating of who has permission to access the Twitter account can prevent unauthorized access.\\n\\n7. Periodic Security Model Updates: Review your security model now and then, especially when there are changes in your organization like a team member leaving or a new member joining and needing access to the account.\\n\\n8. Being familiar with prevalent hacking techniques and conducting regular security checks allow you to proactively defend your account. Understanding the way hackers operate and staying vigilant about your account\'s security offers an extra layer of protection.\\n\\n\\n### Part 5: What to Do if Your Account Gets Compromised\\nIf your account gets compromised, it is **paramount** that you react quickly to mitigate any negative consequences to the community.\\n\\n1. Password Reset: Promptly update your password, making sure to include all associated emails.\\n\\n2. Cease Third-Party Permissions: It\'s crucial to terminate all third-party permissions without delay to prevent further unauthorized access.\\n\\n3. Inform the Community: Immediately alert your community about the compromised account using alternative communication channels such as a secondary Twitter account or other platforms like Discord or Telegram. This would warn them against trusting any new posts from the breached account.\\n\\n4. Contact Twitter Support: If all these measures still yield no improvement, consider reaching out to Twitter\'s customer support, ideally from a different Twitter account. This might aid in further resolving the issue.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, in an era of escalating cyber threats, safeguarding your digital presence is more critical than ever, particularly so for projects that reach a large audience or manage high Total Value Locked (TVL). The stakes for these projects are particularly high due to the significant influence and value they hold. \\n\\nUnderstanding common signs of account compromise, being aware of prevalent hacking methods, creating robust passwords, and consistently refining security settings are not just best practices, they are necessities. Projects must take accountability for their impact and make Twitter account security a constant priority. Always remember, the strength of your online security is only as robust as its weakest link, thus maintaining a secure environment requires consistent vigilance, awareness, and behavior adjustments.\\n\\nFeel free to contact us at support@hashdit.io for any support needed!

The project claimed to be based in Silicon Valley but it was in fact not registered there. Furthermore, Fintoch claimed to be owned by Morgan Stanley. \\n\\nLater on, the Singapore Government issued a warning against this fraud and Morgan Stanley issued a similar one as well.\\n\\n### Stake - $18 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 4th September 2023, the Stake platform was exploited, resulting in almost $18m loss on BSC. Stake is a Betting platform for users to gamble their cryptocurrency on multiple chains. The incident was due to a Private Key Compromise of several of its operating wallets, leading to their funds being directly stolen. However, the eventual root cause was not shared by the project team, and the platform continued business as usual by changing operating wallets subsequently.\\n\\n### Ipp - $15 Million Loss\\nOn 26th May 2023, the Ipp project conducted a rugpull worth nearly $15m worth of USDT. The project has since deleted all its social media accounts.\\n\\nThe root cause of this rugpull was that there was a backdoor function in the staking contract of the project. The backdoor function allowed the scammers to have privileged access to remove users\u2019 staked funds in the contract. \\n\\n### Safemoon - $9 Million Loss\\nSafeMoon markets itself as a decentralized cryptocurrency with reflection rewards for holders. On 28th March 2023, the project was exploited for roughly $9m worth of WBNB funds.\\n\\nThe vulnerability leading to the attack is because of a bug that was introduced in the latest update. Specifically, the burn() function introduced can be called publicly, and secondly the From address can be externally controlled. This means that any address can technically have its $Safemoon tokens burned from their wallet.\\n\\nThe hacker was able to continually call the burn() method, parsing in the address of the Safemoon-WBNB pool. By destroying the number of $Safemoon in the LP pool, the value of $Safemoon is artificially inflated, allowing the hacker to make a back swap for WBNB and profit. \\n\\n### SwapX - $7 Million Loss\\nOn 27th February 2023, SwapX, an AMM project was exploited, resulting in the loss of ~$7m worth of funds on BSC. The victim smart contract which was unverified, had a vulnerable function without proper access control, which misuses the allowances given by other users.\\n\\nThe attacker exploited this vulnerability to swap other users\u2019 funds for other tokens, in other words, users had their funds swapped not on their own accord. As a result, the other tokens such as $DND and $LZ had a price bump which allowed the attacker to make a back swap and profit from the price gap.\\n\\n### Coinex - $6 Million Loss\\nOn 12th September 2023, Coinex, a CEX was exploited for roughly $6m on BSC. Similar to the Stake platform case, the incident was due to a Private Key Compromise of several of its operating wallets, leading to their funds being directly stolen. \\n\\nThis case was found to be linked to North Korea\'s infamous Lazarus group as they laundered funds through multiple channels onchain after the attack.\\nThe project team eventually pledged a 100% refund for all affected users and restarted services after 1 week.\\n\\n### Atlantis Loans - $4 Million Loss\\nOn 12th June 2023, Atlantis Loans was exploited for around 4m. In this attack, the hacker executed a malicious governance proposal to take over all the core contracts of the ecosystem. During the execution, the hacker managed to take over the Admin role of all those core contracts. As such, he injected a malicious implementation to steal the funds of users that have approved to those contracts in the past.\\n\\nInterestingly, the first proposal submitted was actively caught by the community and voted off. However, due to the lack of eyes on the project, the 2nd malicious proposal passed the quorum without sufficient Against votes.\\n\\n### FUT - $3 Million Loss\\nEarly this year, on 4th January 2023, the FUT token rugpulled for nearly $3m worth of funds. These funds were laundered through multiple exchanges.\\n\\nThe loophole is in the Masterchef contract, where there was a backdoor function which allowed the scammer to steal staked funds from users. \\n\\n### $GMETA - $2 Million Loss\\nOn 18th July 2023, $GMETA token conducted an exit scam of ~$2m, resulting in a 96% price drop. \\n\\nThe scam project party minted these large amounts of $GMETA tokens to a dormant address that they have control back in February. Once the price of the token has been pumped substantially, the scammers sold them all for a profit.\\n\\n\\n### Circulate - $2 Million Loss\\nOn 12th January 2023, Circulate executed a rugpull for roughly $2m worth of BUSD. The scam project party managed to hide a malicious code within the unverified contract to steal funds that were staked in the contract. The funds have since been bridged to ETH and laundered through Tornado Cash\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-16Nov2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/PancakeSwap-Security-Report-16Nov2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-16/2023-11-16.md","title":"PancakeSwap November 16th Weekly Security Report","description":"Disclaimer","date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 16, 2023","tags":[{"label":"PancakeSwap","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/pancake-swap"},{"label":"November","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/november"},{"label":"2023","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2023"}],"readingTime":3.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-16Nov2023","title":"PancakeSwap November 16th Weekly Security Report","authors":["Sebastian"],"tags":["PancakeSwap","November","2023"]},"prevItem":{"title":"2023 Top 10 Security Incidents","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/2023-Top10-Incidents"},"nextItem":{"title":"PancakeSwap November 9th Weekly Security Report","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/PancakeSwap-Security-Report-09Nov2023"}},"content":"<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Disclaimer \\n\\n\\n***The information provided through the BNB Chain community does not constitute advice or recommendation for investment or trading.

These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this page (45%)\\n\\n2. Roughly 36% of the newly identified risky addresses were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs. \\n\\n3. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a **privileged role**, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some **centralization risk** as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 18% of the total newly identified risky addresses.\\n\\nRefer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/11162023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.\\n\\nTip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.\\n\\n## Integrations with PancakeSwap\\nHashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBay\u2019s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.\\n\\n\\nExample: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1\\n![IMG-1](../2023-08-31/1.png)\\n\\nThe RedAlarm keyword will link to the risk scanner as seen in the image below.\\n![IMG-2](../2023-08-31/2.png)\\n\\nPlease take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.\\n\\n![IMG-3](../2023-08-31/3.jpeg)\\n\\n## Stay Safe!\\n[HashDit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) advises you to act with caution in general, but ask that you take particular care when dealing with the projects we highlight as risky on our weekly update.

They have been documented relatively well on Web3 newsletters and by security companies in the space.\\nHowever, we noticed that scammers are recently changing some of their techniques, hence we decided to write this blog to offer more understanding of this scam.\\n\\n## Recap\\nThis is how the scam typically work:\\n1. A user notices an unknown airdropped token in his wallet, usually it mimics a valuable or well known token like USDT. In other cases, it might be the latest trends like Friend.Tech.\\n \\n2. He then proceeds to \u201capprove\u201d it to a DEX router such as PancakeSwap, in hopes of selling it for a profit. Subsequently, he tries to swap it on the DEX but to no avail as the transaction reverts. But didn\u2019t he already grant approval for the DEX?\\n \\n3. At the same time, he notices that the token is still in his wallet and he lost some BNB as well. He was scammed!\\n\\n**What actually happens** is that when the user interacts with the unknown token at step 2, the token inadvertently took his gas provided in the transaction to create gas tokens. Furthermore, the gas requested in the transaction will be at unusually high costs.\\n\\n1 popular instance of gas tokens on BSC is the CHI Gas token, you can refer to this [link](https://blog.1inch.io/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-chi-gastoken/) here for more information. Essentially, they are tokens that utilize the \u201cgas refund\u201d feature of the EVM that allows refunds when clearing storage. This allows users to mint gas tokens when fees are low, and burn them when fees are high, effectively \\"locking in\\" the lower fee.\\n\\nIn other words, the victim is minting CHI Gas tokens for the scammer so they can reduce their gas costs in future transactions.\\n\\n**New variations of the scam:**\\n1. Other common ERC20 methods invoke the same scam. For e.g, trying to move the token using the \u201ctransfer\u201d method will lead to users invoking the minting too.\\n \\n2. Recently, we noticed that scammers now prefer to mint XEN tokens with the victim\u2019s gas during the transaction.\\n\\nFor context, XEN is a social mining project based on a Proof of Participation mechanism. XEN tokens are minted using gas as well, and the tokens can only be claimed after a waiting period. XEN tokens do have value in the secondary market. Therefore, scammers can profit by gaining these XEN tokens from you and dumping them later.\\n \\n3. Creating fake approvals. This is not exactly new but we would like to elaborate more on how it works. \\n  \\nRevoke product platforms like [Bscscan](https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker) or [Debank](https://debank.com/) naively log all approval events related to your wallet. Then, they are displayed nicely in a dashboard for you to see.\\nHowever, the issue is that approval events can actually be faked by the scammers.\\n \\nLet\u2019s look at this example:\\nBscScan approver check:\\n\\n![IMG-1](./images/1.png)\\n\\nOn first glance,\\nit looks like this user has multiple unlimited allowance for their tokens. However these are all not real (the token and the approval).\\nThis is my 1 instance of a Fake approval transaction\\nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0x3c3f16b418e6dcc39f03628f288d9aaba1a3cbb2e1843d92d651b61625329a95#eventlog \\n\\nThere are 1000 falsified approvals in just 1 transaction!\\n\\nLooking into each of them, we can see that the token address is fake!\\n\\n![IMG-2](./images/2.png)\\n![IMG-3](./images/3.png)\\n  \\n \\nThe fake token here mimics the INJ token and might appear to be be verified contract. However, it is actually a proxy contract, which points to an unverified logic contract here: 0x54d1527668bd83f719b5414141a912cbbda55382 (**This is where the scam logic is**)\\nThe real INJ token address is 0x**a2b**726b1145a4773f68593cf171187d8ebe4d**495**. *Notice that the token address prefix and suffix are scarily similar to trick victims.\\n\\n## Current landscape of scammers\u2019 methodologies\\nUnderstanding when and how scammers create these scam opportunities will help us be more familiar and to better avoid them.\\n1. Cast a wide-net\\n\\n    - By airdropping fake notable tokens like USDT or USDC to victims\u2019 wallets\\n \\n    - Then by creating fake approval transactions for fake notable tokens like USDT or USDC, which are displayed on revoke pages like [Bscscan](https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker).\\n \\n2. Wait for specific events\\n    \\n    - A hack event happened, airdrop / create fake approval transactions for the related hack project token / spender, so that users will \u2018revoke\u2019 them. For example, a particular project named \\"A\\" has been hacked, the scammers will mint and create a fake approval with a fake token \\"A\\" to the real \\"A\\" holders. As users are taught to revoke access for their \\"A\\" tokens, they see that there is an approval for the fake token \\"A\\" as well, promptly getting scammed of their gas.\\n\\nFor all cases, scammers ensure that the gas provided is enough to mint the scammers\u2019 desired amount of CHI gas tokens or XEN tokens. I.e if the gas is too low, the scam transaction will likely revert.\\n\\n## Security Recommendations from HashDit\\n\\n1. Do not touch any new unknown tokens. These tokens might appear to have value based on a liquidity pool the scammer created. Do not fall for it!\\n \\n2. Always check the token address for legitimacy. You can cross reference this with platforms like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).\\n \\n3. The underlying scam technique requires an unusual high gas cost, hence this is a **major red flag** if seen on the transaction page.\\n \\n4. Use [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/). The platform uses heuristics to filter out fake approvals. Keep in mind this is not 100% so you should still pay attention.\\n  \\nHashDit is actively tracing and blacklisting these scam addresses on our HashDit API. Do download the HashDit chrome [extension](https://tinyurl.com/mnsv3f7y) to safeguard yourself in the future!\\n\\nWe hope that this blog helps educate you on this Gas Mint scam so that you can stay safe in this space.\\nFinal security takeaway: ***do not sign any transactions if you do not know what it does***.\\n\\nFeel free to consult us at our email support@hashdit.io if you have any other queries.\\n \\n</div>"},{"id":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-05Oct2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/PancakeSwap-Security-Report-05Oct2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-05/2023-10-05.md","title":"PancakeSwap October 5th Weekly Security Report","description":"Disclaimer","date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"PancakeSwap","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/pancake-swap"},{"label":"October","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/october"},{"label":"2023","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2023"}],"readingTime":3.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-05Oct2023","title":"PancakeSwap October 5th Weekly Security Report","authors":["Sebastian"],"tags":["PancakeSwap","October","2023"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Gas Mint Scam (Updated!)","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/Gas-Mint-Scam-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"An In-depth Security Analysis ---- The Trend of Hot Wallet Compromises","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/The-Trend-of-Hot\u2013Wallet-Compromises"}},"content":"<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Disclaimer \\n\\n\\n***The information provided through the BNB Chain community does not constitute advice or recommendation for investment or trading.

They are labeled under the DApps section of this [page](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)(31%)\\n\\n2. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a privileged role, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some **centralization** risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 31% of the total newly identified risky addresses.\\n\\n3. A quarter of the newly identified risky addresses (25%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs. \\n\\nRefer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/10052023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.\\n\\nTip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.\\n\\n## Integrations with PancakeSwap\\nHashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBay\u2019s Red Alarm.

In this article, we will analyze these types of attack incidents using several examples and finally provide some practical suggestions from a security perspective to help project teams avoid such breaches in the future.\\n\\n## Stake\'s Unanticipated $41 Million Withdrawals\\n[stake.com](https://stake.com/), a crypto gambling protocol, offers a variety of casino games such as dice, blackjack, Lingo, and more. Additionally, they provide sports betting options for basketball, tennis, volleyball, and others. On September 4th, Stake.com encountered an abnormal outflow of funds, totaling approximately $41 million.\\n\\nThe attack transpired across multiple chains, incurring losses of around $15.7 million on ETH, $7.8 million on Polygon, and $17.8 million on BSC. This brought the cumulative losses to over $41 million.\\n\\nOne of the fraudulent transactions can be traced back to: [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x98610e0a20b5ebb08c40e78b4d2271ae1fbd4fc3b8783b1bb7a5687918fad54e).   \\nFrom the transaction details, it\'s evident that the funds were transferred directly from Stake.com\'s hot wallet: [transaction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x974caa59e49682cda0ad2bbe82983419a2ecc400) to the attacker\'s address. Subsequently, the funds were dispersed among numerous accounts.\\n\\nStake confirmed this security breach via social media, stating, \\"Three hours ago, unauthorized transactions were initiated from Stake\'s ETH/BSC hot wallets.\\" As a result of this security incident, Stake\'s operations were temporarily put on hold.\\n\\n## The CoinEx Fund\'s 6.2 Million Dollar Loss\\nStake.com isn\'t the only entity that has fallen prey to a breach of hot wallet private keys. On September 12, 2023, CoinEx detected irregular withdrawals from several of its hot wallet addresses, which were utilized to store user assets.\\nThe unauthorized transactions affected 19 chains, including $ETH, $TRON, and $MATIC, bringing the total loss to an estimated $55 million.\\n\\nOne particular unauthorized transaction can be seen here: [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa0775ff7c49fd775f86ec961369ab99ceaeeade33334970c696dbd4b35022df3).\\nOne can observe that the assets were directly transferred from CoinEX\'s hot wallet, [transaction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x53eb3ea47643e87e8f25dd997a37b3b5260e7336), to the hacker\'s address. This indicates that the culprits may have managed to seize control of CoinEX\'s hot wallet\'s private key.\\n\\nFollowing the hacking event, CoinEx temporarily suspended crypto deposits/withdrawals, relocated assets to more secure addresses, overhauled and redeployed the wallet system, and engaged in efforts with other exchanges to freeze the attacker\'s assets.\\n\\nUnauthorized Transactions Drain Over $2.7M from Remitano Exchange\\nA mere week after CoinEx fell victim to a cyber intrusion, another exchange, Remitano, succumbed to unauthorized transactions that led to over $2.7 million being pilfered from its wallet across various chains, including #Ethereum and #TRON.\\n\\nTo illustrate the scenario, consider one of the unauthorized transactions on the ETH chain: [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe0725362fd774de0d8416d5e3d028063508ffa61f68087c576320e42159677a9). \\n\\nWe can observe that approximately 1.3M USDT was directly shifted from Remitano\'s hot wallet [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2819c144d5946404c0516b6f817a960db37d4929) to the assailant\'s address [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x74530e81E9f4715c720b6b237f682CD0e298B66C). Consequently, the perceived Remitano hack also appears to be a consequence of their hot wallet\'s private key leakage. This presumably allowed the hacker to gain direct control over the hot wallet and transfer all assets.\\n\\nGratefully, Tether responded promptly and froze two addresses allegedly utilized by the assailant on both the #Ethereum and #TRON chains, potentially preserving 2.7M $USDT.\\n\\n## Security Recommendations from HashDit\\n\\nSince last September, numerous instances of hot wallet private key leaks have rattled various projects. Though Stake and CoinEx have stated that the affected funds comprise only a minor share of total assets, and users\' funds are safeguarded, Twitter responses reveal growing public suspicion of insider activities at these projects, dramatically undermining user trust. These incidents underscore the significance of proactive risk management concerning project wallets and funds. HashDit, consistently carrying out related security tasks, offers the following recommendations based on our experience in averting hacking incidents:\\n\\n1. **Adopt Comprehensive Address Planning and Isolation Design**: For high balance addresses, refrain from frequent participation in DeFi contract operations. Replenish hot wallet balances regularly in batches to minimize balance fluctuations and risk exposure.\\n2. **Enforce Distributed Access Rights**: Avoid allotting comprehensive access rights to the hot wallet to a single entity. Utilize a multisig wallet or MPC solution to necessitate multiple approvals for transactions, bolstering security measures.\\n3. **Monitor Key Management**: Treat the access key to hot wallets as a critical asset and protect it with a suite of physical and digital measures. Avoid storing key duplicates on vulnerable networks, like emails or cloud storage.\\n4. **Initiate Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits on hot wallets to identify prospective threats or vulnerabilities. Regularly reinforce and upgrade security measures, including ensuring the appropriateness of hot wallet approvals.\\n5. **Institute Transfer Limits**: Establish a cap for single or daily transactions to mitigate potential losses.\\n6. **Implement Ongoing Education and Training**: Provide continuous security education for team members engaged in asset management, arming them with the ability to recognize and counteract potential threats.  \\n7. **Craft Backup and Recovery Plans**: Devise a robust plan to ensure swift recovery during unanticipated incidents.\\n8. **Maintain Secure Operations**: Avoid transacting over unencrypted networks and processing in vulnerable settings, like public WiFi environments.\\n9. **Activate Two-Step Verification**: Implement two-step verification for all accounts and services associated with the hot wallet.\\n10. **Leverage Audit Logs**: Preserve and periodically review all hot wallet operation logs to detect and trace any suspicious activities.\\nThese are broad suggestions for hot wallet management, yet specific strategies may need tailoring based on individual projects. Don\'t hesitate to reach out to HashDit for any security consultation. Our mission is to secure your WEB3 journey.\\n\\n## Related Reading\\nhttps://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/smart-wallet-migration-guide \\n\\n\\n## About HashDit?\\n[HashDit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) is building a safe blockchain ecosystem on BNB Chain by providing threat intelligence, code auditing and instant analysis for smart contracts.

The second most was a GameFi project at 0.18% (TalesofElleria \u2013 Signature compromised), followed by MEV at 0.01% (an unknown MEV contract had a lack of validation bug).\\n\\n![IMG-2](./l2_images/2.png)\\n\\nWith a large proportion of fiat loss associated with DeFi projects, this shows that DeFi projects are still the most common type of crypto project on L2 chains.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n## Chain comparison\\n \\nAccording to our data, 38.82% of financial loss was from the Arbitrum chain (~$57.95m).\\nBASE being a new chain, accounted for 22.84% (~$34m). This is followed by Optimism and lastly Avalanche.\\n\\n![IMG-3](./l2_images/3.png)\\n \\nOn Optimism, there were 7 hacks and 1 scam cases.\\nOn Arbitrum, there were 23 hacks (including a White-hat) and 9 scam cases.\\nOn Avalanche, there were 9 hacks (including a White-hat) 2 scam cases.\\nOn BASE, there were 2 hacks and 4 scam cases.\\n \\n## Attack Type analysis\\n \\n \\nThe next chart shows the attack type analysis for all the security incidents on L2 chains. 58.53% was because of Hacks, 40.31% was due to Scams, while 1.17% was rescued by a White hat.\\n\\n![IMG-4](./l2_images/4.png)\\n\\nThe next chart shows the specific attack vector analysis.\\n\\n![IMG-5](./l2_images/5.png)\\n\\nAs seen in the chart above, the highest financial loss attributed to rugpulls with $56.75m, $28.6m was due to MPC compromise (Multichain incident), and $9m was due to Internal accounting.\\n \\nFurther analyzing the top 3 attack vectors,\\nRugpulls - 13 cases (Most notably the $BALD case).\\nMPC compromise - 3 cases (1 Multichain incident across 3 chains).\\nInternal accounting - 2 cases (Mostly due to the Platypus case).\\n\\n## Top 10 incidents on L2 thus far\\nThe following were the top 10 security incidents on L2, 3 of them were scams while the other 7 were exploit cases.\\n \\n![IMG-6](./l2_images/6.png)\\n \\n### [BALD](https://twitter.com/BaldBaseBald) - $25.6 Million Scam\\nOn 1-Aug-2023, BALD, a meme token on BASE was reported to have rug pulled $25.6 million USD from investors.\\nMethod: The liquidity of the BASE tokens were held by an EOA account, hence the account could remove liquidity at any time.\\nAlthough the Base network is meant to be used for developer testing, some people have tried to trade on the network before its official launch\\nhttps://decrypt.co/150647/bald-coin-based-ethereum-base-layer-2-coinbase \\nSince removing liquidity though, he has appeared to still be adding/removing small chunks of liquidity (probably still trying to garner traffic)\\nhttps://basescan.org/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006?a=0xfcd3842f85ed87ba2889b4d35893403796e67ff1 \\n \\n### [Multichain](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/detail/multichain) - $28.6 Million Exploit\\nOn 10-July-2023, a Bridge project, Multichain had its MPC account compromised by an unknown entity. The MPC account had authority over the bridged funds of users, and transferred all the funds to his own wallet, on 3 chains: Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche. Since the MPC account appears as a normal EOA on-chain, it is unclear how the MPC account was compromised on the backend.\\n \\n \\n### [Defrost](https://twitter.com/Defrost_Finance) - $12 Million Scam\\nThe Defrost project was rugged for a total of $12 million USD on 23-Dec-2022. The incident happened on Avalanche.\\nMethod: The privileged owner was an EOA which could change the address of the oracle, in a market contract. He changed the address maliciously to one that returns fake prices, to liquidate their users and seize their funds.\\nAt that point of time, it looked pretty obvious that it was a rugpull. However, the project party claimed that they were hacked 4 days later and stated that the exploiter has returned 100% of funds to them https://medium.com/@Defrost_Finance/hacked-funds-returned-to-defrost-71b9d2d1b458 \\nIn this case, it appears that they were caught so they returned the funds back.\\n \\n### [Platypus](https://twitter.com/platypusdefi) - $8.75 Million Exploit\\nOn 17-Feb-2023, Platypus, a Lending/Borrowing project, was exploited, resulting in users losing more than $8.75 million USD. The incident happened on Avalanche.\\nRoot cause: The project party overlooked the EmergencyWithdraw() method and forgot to include a check for borrowed funds https://twitter.com/danielvf/status/1626340324103663617?s=61&t=gr5sMl7K7qjCB7l3zmh53w \\nMethod: The hacker deposited funds, borrowed funds and then exited his position with EmergencyWithdraw(), allowing him to keep the borrowed funds\\n \\n### [Jimbos](https://twitter.com/BaselineMarkets) - $7.5 Million Exploit\\nOn 2023-05-28, Jimbos Protocol on Abitrum was exploited, which resulted in ~$7.5m funds loss.\\nRoot cause: The protocol did not have proper measures to manage price changes during operations that shift liquidity.\\nThis oversight allows the protocol\'s own liquidity to be put into a distorted price range, which allows attackers to make \\"profit\\" via a reverse swap.\\nMethod: 1) The hacker initially flash loaned 10,000 WETH\\n2) Subsequently swaps them for $JIMBO, inflating its price\\n3) Called the shift() method in JimboController to manipulate reserves and imbalance the pool\\n4) Following the manipulation, the attacker converted the acquired Jimbo tokens back into ETH\\n \\n### [Exactly](https://twitter.com/ExactlyProtocol) - $7.32 Million Exploit\\nExactly Protocol, a Lending/Borrowing platform was hacked on Optimism for $7.32m.\\nRoot cause: Lack of validation -> allowed the attacker to steal users\u2019 collateral assets\\n \\n![IMG-7](./l2_images/7.png) \\n \\nThe attacker was able to bypass the permit check in the leverage function of the DebtManager contract by directly passing a fake market address without validation\\n  \\nUntrusted external call done with the fake market address -> the attacker reentered the crossDeleverage function in the DebtManager contract and stole the collaterals from the _msgSender.\\n\\n![IMG-8](./l2_images/8.png)\\n![IMG-9](./l2_images/9.png)\\n\\nSecondly, the Permit calldata p can be externally controlled too, changing the _msgSender to the victim address (user EOA address).\\n \\n### [Hundred Finance](https://twitter.com/HundredFinance) - $7 Million Exploit\\nHundred Finance, a Lending/Borrowing platform was hacked on Optimism for $7m. The hack was due to a known bug in Compound V2 code.\\n \\nRoot cause: The exchange rate can be manipulated because of a rounding issue in the redeemFresh of CToken pool contract (The attacker strictly controls the input quantity every time they call the redeemUnderlying function. This leads to a situation where the calculated result becomes 1.99999999999... but is rounded down to 1 by default.)\\n \\n### [Lodestar Financ](https://twitter.com/LodestarFinance)  - $6.9 Million Exploit\\nLodestar Finance, a Lending/Borrowing project, was hacked on Arbitrum for $6.9m. This attack vector is 1 variation of the donation-bug vulnerability.\\n \\nThe attacker first manipulated the exchange rate of the plvGLP contract to 1.83 GLP per plvGLP, \\"an exploit that by itself would be unprofitable\\", said the company.\\n \\nThen, the attacker supplied plvGLP collateral to Lodestar and borrowed all available liquidity, cashing out part of the funds \\"until the collateralization ratio mechanism prevented a full liquidation of the plvGLP.\\"\\n \\nFollowing the hack, \\"several plvGLP holders also took advantage of the opportunity and also cashed out at 1.83 glp per plvGLP.\\" The hacker was able to burn a little over 3 million in GLP, making profit on the \\"stolen funds on Lodestar - minus the GLP they burned.\\", noted the DeFi platform.\\n \\n### [Magnate Finance](https://twitter.com/MagnateFi) - $6.4 Million Scam\\nMagnate Finance, a scam project, rug pulled for $6.4m. Incident was on the BASE blockchain.\\nMoments before the rug, it was found that its deployer address is directly linked to the Solfire $4.8M exit scam. \\n \\nThe project team manipulated the price oracle value, so he could drain all the locked funds in the market contract.\\n \\n### [Deus DAO (DEI)](https://twitter.com/DeusDao) - $5 Million Exploit\\nOn 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $5 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on Arbitrum. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.\\n \\nThe issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\n\\nL2 blockchains offer several advantages over traditional L1 chains such as Increased Scalability, Lower Fees and Faster Transaction Times. However, the issues that plague L1 chains do persist on L2 chains as well. \\n\\nTherefore, we advise the opBNB community to pay more attentions on the below segments.\\n1. Developers\' concerns\\n2. Users\' concerns\\n\\n### Developers should\\n1. Pay special attention to over-centralization. Privileged roles should be transferred to a multisig or timelock.\\n2. Pay attention to oracle / price manipulation attacks. Ensure the oracle is a trusted source, and use a backup oracle to check discrepancy so that prices will not deviate too much.\\n3. For lending/borrowing projects, pay close attention to exchange rates to ensure the rate cannot be manipulated by forceful donation and breaking any invariants.\\n4. Ensure all state-changing functions have proper checks for all parameters so there will not be a situation of having unexpected inputs not validated.\\n5. Ensure all token standards are followed.\\n6. Ensure contract upgrades are done after review from a trustable auditor.\\n \\n### Users should\\n1. Invest in trustable tokens, instead of over centralization and hype meme coins as such projects are high risks and might result in it being scams.\\n2. Invest in projects that have partnered with 3rd party security companies.\\n\\n\\nFor further inquiries or clarifications, do drop us an email at **support@hashdit.io**!

There has been an increase in exit scam incidents this month, with notable cases including a $680k rugpull by the NFT_SalesRoom (ASN) team. Additionally, there has been an increase in fake tokens that conducted a rugpull such as 2 Fake $CIRCLE tokens, 1 Fake $Zksync token and 1 Fake $X token.\\n\\n## Security Control Improvements in the BSC Ecosystem\\n1. HashDit has integrated its security API with Prominent and Leading brands on BSC such as [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/), [BscScan](https://trustwallet.com/) to improve the security control across the ecosystem.\\n- @PancakeSwap: Auto-scans tokens & displays risk scores\\n\\n![IMG-2](./august_incidents/2.png)\\n\\n- @TrustWallet: Notifies users of high risks before transactions\\n\\n![IMG-3](./august_incidents/3.png)\\n\\n- @bscscan: Displays risk warnings in the explorer\\n\\n![IMG-4](./august_incidents/4.png)\\n\\n2. New risks flagged in [RedAlarm](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)\\n\\nA total of 319 dApps and 64 addresses were added to Hashdit\'s RedAlarm in August alone.\\nThis amounts to a total of 1679 smart contracts on RedAlarm currently.\\n\\n## Word of Advice\\nWith the current trends in the BSC security landscape, Hashdit advices the community to:\\n1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before participating in any trending projects to mitigate the risk of financial losses, especially when the token name and symbol is an impersonation of the real token.\\n2. Place greater emphasis on security, adopt a Zero-Trust security mentality and be careful of phishing scams \\n\\nMeanwhile, HashDit promises to continue to keep the BSC community and its users safe!\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-31Aug2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/PancakeSwap-Security-Report-31Aug2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-31/2023-08-31.md","title":"PancakeSwap August 31st Weekly Security Report","description":"Disclaimer","date":"2023-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"PancakeSwap","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/pancake-swap"},{"label":"August","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/august"},{"label":"2023","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2023"}],"readingTime":3.18,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"},{"name":"Chris","title":"SCS@HashDit","key":"Chris"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"PancakeSwap-Security-Report-31Aug2023","title":"PancakeSwap August 31st Weekly Security Report","authors":["Sebastian","Chris"],"tags":["PancakeSwap","August","2023"]},"prevItem":{"title":"BNB Smart Chain Monthly Incident Report August 2023 - 60% drop of total incident amounts","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/BSC-August-Security-Report"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ponzi Schemes in Web3 ---- Swamps in the Dark","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/ponzi-schemes-in-web3"}},"content":"## Disclaimer \\n\\n\\n***The information provided through the BNB Chain community does not constitute advice or recommendation for investment or trading.

Please seek professional advice\\nbefore taking financial risks.*\\n\\n### What\'s a \\"ponzi\\"?\\n\\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme),\\nthe\xa0**Ponzi scheme**\xa0is a form of\xa0fraud\xa0that lures\xa0new investors\xa0and\\npays\xa0profits\xa0to earlier investors with\xa0funds\xa0from more recent investors.\\nAs you can imagine, if recent investors pay to earlier investors\\nthen... who pays the recent investors? The answer is, the even more\\nrecent investors. And if there are no more recent investors, then the\\nlatest ones remain with a loss, and the scheme collapses.\\n\\nThe ponzi scheme is often referred to as pyramid scheme,\\nbecause to pay the \\"higher floor\\" investors with a profit, a\\nlarger, \\"lower floor\\" has to be created, like in the picture below.\\n\\n![](media/image1.jpg)\\n\\n*https://sperrinlaw.net/financial-crime-fraud/ponzi-fraud/*\\n\\nSince the pyramid is not a real business, in terms of creating a\\nproduct or a service and leveraging it to earn money on the market, in\\norder to keep the funds flowing in, new investors have to be recruited\\nand their \\"investment\\" is used to pay the old investors, who can then\\nreport significant returns on their investments. This creates an\\nillusion of a profitable business, at least as long, as the current\\n\\"lowest floor\\" manages to recruit new members.\\n\\nIf that\'s so obvious, then why people keep falling for it? Usually, the\\nponzi schemes are disguised as legitimate investments or projects. They\\nwill do everything to hide it\'s true nature so the new coming investors\\nwill believe they just met an investment of their lifetime. And when the\\nscheme falls, it\'s already too late to run away.\\n\\nAre there ponzi schemes in web3? If so, how to spot them? How not to\\nlose money?

These\\nschemes use smart contracts to automate their operations, making them\\nharder to detect while promising high returns on investments.\\n\\n3. **Tokenization:** Some Ponzi schemes create their own tokens and use\\nthem for fundraising. They offer high rewards in the form of tokens,\\nwhich may have little to no real value.\\n\\n4. **Limited regulation:** The DeFi space has limited regulation,\\nmaking it easier for Ponzi schemes to operate without being detected or\\nshut down by financial authorities.\\n\\n5. **Low cost:** Ponzi scheme projects can be fully autonomous and\\ndeployed at lower costs. They can even be continuously cloned.\\n\\n\\n**So, how can one identify if a Web3 DeFi project is a Ponzi scheme or\\nnot?**\\n\\nFirstly, let\'s look at the project characteristics. Ponzi schemes\\nusually have the following features:\\n\\n1. Typical Web3 Ponzi schemes often employ **aggressive marketing**\\ntactics, promising **high and fixed short-term returns**. For example,\\nthe official websites of such projects usually contain descriptions like\\n\\"**fixed daily profit**\\". However, we know that fixed daily returns\\nare unrealistic, and this is one of the biggest flaws in Ponzi schemes.\\nIn the cases we\'ve accumulated, some Ponzi projects have even promised\\n**25% daily** interest rates!\\n\\n2. **High Referral Incentives**: Ponzi schemes often combine with\\npyramid scheme marketing, aiming to attract more new investors and\\nsubsequent investment funds. Therefore, they often advertise a referral\\nreward system on their official websites, sometimes even with\\nmulti-level referral rewards. Typical pyramid scheme descriptions\\ninclude terms like \\"tiered referral rewards.\\"\\nThe two images below are tiered referral reward system diagrams taken\\nfrom Ponzi scheme websites:\\n\\n ![](media/image2.jpg)\\n\\n ![](media/image3.jpg)\\n\\n\\n3. These schemes usually disguise themselves as **staking or mining**\\nprojects to attract investors\' principal investments and recruit new\\nparticipants. However, in fact, they generally do not offer any real\\nproducts or services but just **promise an ability to make money**. They\\noften incorporate some popular trends, for example, AI or ChatGPT,\\npromoting their projects as groundbreaking and innovative, as they need\\nto attract more people and **maintain an appearance of legitimacy**.\\n\\nBelow are some additional features that can help investors determine\\nwhether a project is a Ponzi scheme. Please note that these traits are\\nnot exclusive to Ponzi scheme projects. Generally, the more of these a\\nproject has, the higher the risk:\\n\\n1.  No proper investments: The project appears to have no investments\\n    or partnerships, which means that the project lacks any business\\n    endorsements.\\n\\n2.  Opaque team information: The team behind the project remains\\n    anonymous to the public, making it easier for such projects to\\n    engage in malicious activities with lower costs.\\n\\n3.  Lack of documentation: There is a lack of documentation and\\n    whitepapers, as the project does not provide details about its\\n    internal operations and how it achieves these high returns. This is\\n    a potential red flag.\\n\\n4.  No external audit report: Projects with audit reports generally\\n    have a relatively smaller chance of encountering security issues.\\n    However, please note that having an audit report does not guarantee\\n    absolute security, as the audit report may only cover certain\\n    contracts and not examine the entire economic ecosystem of the\\n    project. The reliability of the audit report is also important,\\n    depending on the issuer and quality; well-known and reputable audit\\n    companies usually have greater credibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Decrypting a Ponzi project smart contract\\n\\nAre you a more tech-savvy user? That\'s great. If you have some\\nfamiliarity with Solidity code or want to learn it, we encourage you to\\ngo through the code snippets below to understand some of the\\ncharacteristics of Ponzi scheme smart contracts.\\n\\nAs we mentioned earlier, Ponzi scheme Web3 projects generally don\'t\\nhave any real products, and therefore don\'t require many smart\\ncontracts. In their entire project ecosystem, there are usually only a\\nfew investment contracts that directly interact with users. At most,\\nthere might be an additional token contract, with the token often\\nserving as a staking reward. However, this token typically won\'t be\\ncreated on any decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning that holders of\\nthis token cannot swap it for other valuable tokens or\\nstablecoins.\\n\\nNext, we will delve into the characteristics of Ponzi investment smart\\ncontracts by using some code snippets as examples.\\n\\n\\n\\n1.  **There is no method in the contract to withdraw the initial\\n    investment; it only allows for receiving dividends based on time**\\n\\n    For example, in the below withdraw function, users cannot withdraw\\n    their principal investment; they can only withdraw dividends along\\n    with potential referral earnings.\\n\\n This is also the difference between Ponzi schemes and regular\\n mining/staking contracts.\\n\\n ![](media/image4.jpg)\\n\\n2.  **Dividends are calculated based on a fixed daily returns ROI and\\n    time.**\\n    For example, in the getUserDividends function below, the user\'s\\n    dividend is calculated by multiplying the fixed daily return rate\\n    for the user\'s deposit plan by the time elapsed. Typically, the\\n    daily return ROI is a hard-coded value or constant.\\n\\n ![](media/image5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\n3.  **The code contains logic related to a Referral system.**\\n    As we mentioned earlier, Ponzi investment smart contracts usually\\n    include a referral system, providing users with additional\\n    incentives for bringing new users into the scheme.\\n\\n    For example, in the contract below, there is a tiered referral\\n    reward mechanism, with first, second, and third-level referrers\\n    receiving referral rewards at a ratio of 9:2:1.\\n\\n ![](media/image6.jpg)\\n\\n Of course, the referral rewards come from the principal investment of\\n later investors. As can be seen, the invest function in the code\\n distributes part of the user\'s investment amount to all referrers at\\n their respective levels.\\n\\n ![](media/image7.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\n4.  **The project party generates revenue by charging tax fees on\\n    users\' deposits.**\\n    For example, in the code below, the project party charges a 5% dev\\n    fee on the user\'s principal, so they can profit as long as there\\n    are new users, regardless of how much money remains in the\\n    pool.\\n\\n ![](media/image8.jpg)\\n\\n ![](media/image9.jpg)\\n\\n\\n However, sometimes the project party does not directly impose a tax\\n fee, claiming to have a 0% tax fee. In reality, the project party can\\n become the initial referrer and continuously profit through the\\n referral mechanism. This method of profiting is just more\\n concealed.\\n\\n### **Go further: A complete Ponzi example for more tech-savvy users**\\n\\nLet\'s go further! we created a sample ponzi scheme code based on what\\nwe\'re finding during our everyday work. We encourage you to study below\\nsimple smart contract code.\\n\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract PonziScheme {\\n    address public owner;\\n    mapping(address => uint) public investments;\\n    mapping(address => uint) public recruits;\\n    mapping(address => uint) public investmentTimestamp;\\n\\n    constructor() {\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function recruitAndInvest(address referralAddress) public payable {\\n        require(msg.sender != referralAddress, \\"Cannot refer yourself\\");\\n        require(investments[msg.sender] == 0, \\"Already invested\\");\\n        require(msg.value == 0.1 ether, \\"Investment should be 0.1 Ether for recruitment bonus\\");\\n        // Add the recruit count for the referrer\\n        recruits[referralAddress]++;\\n        // Add the investment for the new investor with the bonus\\n        investments[msg.sender] = msg.value + 0.1 ether; // 0.1 ether bonus\\n        investmentTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;\\n    }\\n\\n    function calculateTotalReturn(address investor) public view returns(uint) {\\n        uint numberOfRecruits = recruits[investor];\\n        uint baseInvestment = investments[investor];\\n        uint profit = 0;\\n        if (numberOfRecruits >= 10) {\\n            profit = baseInvestment * 50 / 100; // 50% ROI\\n        } else if (numberOfRecruits >= 5) {\\n            profit = baseInvestment * 25 / 100; // 25% ROI\\n        }\\n        return baseInvestment + profit; // Total return = initial investment + profit\\n    }\\n\\n    function cashOut() public {\\n        uint totalReturn = calculateTotalReturn(msg.sender);\\n        if (totalReturn == investments[msg.sender]) {\\n            require(block.timestamp >= investmentTimestamp[msg.sender] + 90 days, \\"Minimum 90 days required to withdraw without recruits\\");\\n        }\\n        require(address(this).balance >= totalReturn, \\"Insufficient funds in the contract\\");\\n        msg.sender.transfer(totalReturn);\\n        investments[msg.sender] = 0;\\n        recruits[msg.sender] = 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n-   **Entry Point:** The entry point for new investors is the\\n    *recruitAndInvest()* function. Here, a new investor specifies a\\n    referral address (the person who introduced them to the scheme) and\\n    sends 0.1 ether as their investment. \\n\\n-   **Incentive to Recruit:** The incentive to recruit new members is\\n    twofold: Frist, the referrer gets a count increase in their recruits\\n    mapping, which will later increase their ROI. Second, the new\\n    investor gets a bonus of 0.1 ether added to their investment,\\n    effectively doubling their initial investment. \\n\\n-   **Ponzi Mechanics:** The Ponzi nature of the scheme is visible in\\n    the *calculateTotalReturn* function. The ROI is determined by the\\n    number of recruits: 5-9 recruits: 25% ROI 10 or more recruits: 50%\\n    ROI The more people an investor recruits, the higher their promised\\n    return. \\n\\n-   **Potential Collapse:** The scheme can collapse at some point. The\\n    ability to withdraw funds is implemented in the *cashOut()*\\n    function. If the contract doesn\'t have enough funds to pay out the\\n    total return (initial investment + profit), the cash out will fail.\\n    This will happen if not enough new investors are coming in to fund\\n    the returns for earlier investors. The\\n    *require(address(this).balance >= totalReturn, \\"Insufficient funds\\n    in the contract\\");* line checks for this. \\n\\n-   **Safety Net (or Illusion of One):** If an investor hasn\'t\\n    recruited at least 5 people, they can only withdraw their initial\\n    investment after 90 days. This might give the illusion of safety and\\n    legitimacy, but it\'s just a delay tactic. During the 90 days, the\\n    scheme might already rise and fall, and when the time for withdrawal\\n    comes, there might already be no funds on the contract.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow you have a deeper understanding of the contract code for Ponzi\\nschemes. However, in reality, some Ponzi smart contracts are even\\nclosed-source, making them opaque and more difficult to analyze and\\nunderstand, thereby concealing the contract\'s logic and risks from\\nusers. When dealing with closed-source contracts, we should maintain an\\neven higher level of vigilance and examine both the project and contract\\nlevels comprehensively to determine if they exhibit characteristics of a\\nPonzi scheme.\\n\\n### Identifying Ponzi schemes in a more simple way\\n\\nIn summary, before investing in Web3 DeFi projects, you need to conduct\\nthorough due diligence to avoid mistakenly entering Ponzi schemes and\\nincurring losses.\\n\\nAt the project level, conduct comprehensive research on the project\\nteam, token economy, and underlying technology. Be cautious of\\nunrealistic high return promises, ensure that there is adequate\\ntransparency in the project, and verify that the project has a sound\\ngovernance mechanism.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the smart contract level, fully understand the source code and\\ndetermine if there are any red flags in the code, always assessing risks\\nbefore gaining a deeper understanding.\\n\\nHowever, is this too complicated and difficult? After all, not all\\ninvestors are technical experts. Don\'t worry, HashDit can help\\nyou.\\n\\nFor smart contracts, you can scan whether it is a Ponzi contract\\nthrough https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/risk-scanner using the contract\\naddress.

occurring on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during 2023 H1. It analyzes the types of projects that were targeted and whether they shared common attack techniques. Additionally, the report examines the financial implications of these occurrences.\\n\\n#### Disclaimer\\n\\nThe financial data presented in this report has undergone thorough verification through our internal monitoring system, ensuring its accuracy. The data is derived from the $USD valuation of the cryptocurrency at the time of the incident. It\'s important to note that due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency prices, there may be variations in the total amount lost based on current token valuations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true \u201cexploited amount\u201d of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### BSC Innovations\\nThe first half of 2023 has been an exciting journey for BNB Smart Chain (BSC), marked by continuous innovation and the tireless efforts of the BNB Chain team in crafting and advancing cutting-edge technologies.\\n\\nJust to name a few in H1:\\n\\n- The [Greenfield Testnet](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/en) went Live: The Greenfield testnet, is an open-source project aimed at providing a scalable and efficient data availability layer for decentralized applications (dApps).\\n\\n![IMG-1](./gnfd.jpeg)\\n\\n- [Reduced Transaction Costs](https://forum.bnbchain.org/t/a-proposal-for-adopting-a-lower-transaction-fee-cost-on-bnb-smart-chain-to-enhance-competitiveness/): Following extensive discussions, BSC validators have lowered transaction costs from **5 Gwei to 3 Gwei**. This reduction in fees will help drive network adoption, making BNB Chain an even more attractive platform for developers and users. \\n\\n- [BSC Validators Self-Stake Update](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/BSC-FAQs-validator): Thanks to an on-chain governance proposal, validators significantly reduced the cost to become a BNB Smart Chain validator, fostering a more diverse and robust ecosystem. This change greatly benefits the community by improving entry cost to be a BSC validator. Self-Staked moved from **10,000 BNB** to **2,000 BNB**.\\n\\n- BNB Chain exhibited a significant rise in market share, demonstrating steady growth in the percentage of verified smart contracts. Its market share increased from **38%** at the beginning of Q2 to **45%** by the end of H1. This performance underscores BNB Chain\'s dominance and the high level of trust placed in its infrastructure by developers and users.\\n\\n![IMG-2](./contracts_verified.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 1: Number of contracts verified weekly across chains (Refer to the Red box for 2023 H1 data)\\n</p>\\n\\n- [opBNB](https://opbnb.bnbchain.org/en) and [zkBNB](https://zkbnb.bnbchain.org/): These dynamic layer 2 solutions are poised to revolutionize the BNB Chain ecosystem by further enhancing the capabilities of BNB Chain\u2019s ecosystem; offering developers a boundless horizon to pioneer groundbreaking advancements. \\n\\n![IMG-3](./opbnb.png)\\n![IMG-4](./zkbnb.jpeg)\\n\\n[Refer to the blogs [1](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/bnb-chain-q1-tech-updates-innovations-and-opportunities-for-developers/), [2](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/web3-in-numbers-verified-smart-contracts-surged-in-q2-2023-despite-bear-market/) released by BNBChain for more information]\\n\\n\\n## 2023 H1 in focus\\n\\n### General\\n\\nA comprehensive overview reveals that security incidents on BSC resulted in an aggregate loss of nearly $101.84 million. An examination of the monthly breakdown highlights notable patterns. Specifically, the months of May, March, and June emerged as pivotal periods, witnessing the highest recorded losses.  \\n\\n![IMG-5](./Month_overview.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 2: Amount of stolen funds in dollars per month in 2023 H1\\n</p>\\n\\nThis chart shows the number of projects impacted by exploits in 2023 H1.\\n\\n![IMG-6](./Month_Incidents.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Number of different project impacted by exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nIn total, there were 199 incidents on BSC.\\n\\nAs seen in Figure 3, the highest number of security incidents took place in June.\\n\\n\\n### Comparison with H1 previous years\\n\\nWhen we compare the data with H1 of previous years, there is a decreasing trend, which can signify that the security posture of BNB Chain has improved over the years.\\n\\n![IMG-7](./Comparison_with_past_years.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Financial Loss across the previous H1 of 2020 - 2023\\n</p>\\n\\n### Type of attack vectors\\nOut of the 199 security incidents, hacks took up 66.3%, 33.2% were scams. However,  1 particular incident (0.5%) was a white-hat hack. The white-hat [hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hashflow-users-made-whole-after-600k-exploit) is related to a Hashflow project, where an old contract had an Open Approval, this means that any users that have approved funds to the victim contract can have his existing funds stolen.\\n\\n![IMG-8](./Proportion_Exploit_Type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 5: Proportion of different type of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nHowever, it is interesting to note that even when the number of hacks are nearly doubled to that of scams, the financial impact of hacks were less significant than the ones related to the scams. The total financial loss of hacks ($35m) was nearly half of the loss to scams ($66m), as shown below in Figure 6 below.\\n\\n![IMG-9](./Fiat_Exploit_Type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 6: Financial impact measured in dollars comparing different types of incidents\\n</p>\\nLooking at the comparison with 2022 H1, we observed that this trend was actually reversed! In 2022, the number of scam incidents was double that of hack cases, with the financial loss of hacks being double that of scams. You can refer to our previous [report]((https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/bsc-2022-end-of-year-report/)) for more information.\\n\\nThe observed trend potentially signifies an escalating presence of scammers within the crypto space. Their tactics continuously evolve, challenging users\' vigilance. Furthermore, smaller, lesser-known projects may exhibit comparatively lower emphasis on security measures. This underscores the pressing need for heightened awareness and diligence across the ecosystem to safeguard against emerging threats. \\n\\n### Specific attack vectors\\n\\nFigure 7 displays the specific attack vectors against its financial loss in 2023 H1.\\n\\n\\n![IMG-10](./Type_of_exploits_this_month.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 7: Proportion of the funds lost comparing the different type of vulnerabilities\\n</p>\\n\\nLooking at the breakdown, the most common loss of funds was attributed to Rugpulls (25%),  while the second most common attack vector was due to  Reflection Vulnerability. Several token smart contracts deployed on BSC utilize the Reflection mechanism for token holders to gain dividends, however the reflection implementation might be flawed, leading to its liquidity pool being drained by malicious actors. The third most common attack vector was Price Manipulation at 8.2%. This is common as well since poorly designed smart contracts rely on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, and hence can be easily manipulated by a large Swap trade or Flash Loan by hackers.\\n\\n### Type of projects\\n\\nWhen comparing the types of project with the observed financial loss, a whopping 98.8% of financial loss were attributed to DeFi projects.\\nThe second most common type of projects that were targeted wasBridge projects at 0.6%, followed by GameFi and Metaverse projects at 0.3% and 0.2% respectively.\\n\\n![IMG-11](./Project_type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 8: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project \\n</p>\\n\\nWith a large proportion of fiat loss associated with DeFi projects, this  that DeFi projects are still the most common type of crypto project in the space. At the same time, it shows how important it is for users to only invest in reputable and well audited projects, and to stay clear of potential rugpulls and vulnerabilities.\\n\\n### Top 10 incidents in 2023 H1\\n\\nThe following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial loss in 2023 H1. \\n\\n![IMG-12](./Top10_Incidents.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 9: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2023 H1 on the BNB Smart Chain\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Fintoch - $31.6 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 25-May-2023, Fintoch, a Ponzi platform was reported to have rugpulled $31.6 million USD. The funds were since bridged to multiple addresses on Tron and Ethereum. Its users reported that they could not withdraw their funds.\\n\\nFintoch advertises themselves as a blockchain financial platform built by Morgan Stanley, and users can get 1% return on investment every day. The team\u2019s page on the Fintoch website refers \\"Bobby Lambert\'\' as their CEO, when in fact he did not exist and was, in fact,  a paid actor. Earlier, the Singaporean government and Morgan Stanley both [issued](https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/global-offices/pdf/Indonesia/Indonesia_Fintoch_Important_Notice.pdf) warnings about this \u201cinvestment plan\u201d.\\n\\n#### ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 26-May-2023, a scam project, ippswap was found to have rugpulled $14.5 million USD. The ippswap project executed a concerning action by exploiting a privileged backdoor method, takeToken(), within the staking contract. This unauthorized maneuver allowed the project party to transfer IPPSwap LP Tokens, which had been staked by users, directly to their own account.  Liquidity was then subsequently removed using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT.\\n\\nSome of the USDT funds flowed onto Binance exchange where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.\\n\\n#### Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss\\n\\nThe Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.\\n\\nOn April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, and transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, taxing the remaining 20% as a bounty.\\n\\n#### SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss\\n\\nSwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they have not used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they have not revoked their approvals.\\n\\n#### Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the core team whichresulted in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.\\n\\nHowever, a similar proposal was submitted on June 12, and was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved the Atlantis Loans core contracts.\\n\\n#### $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss\\n\\nEarly this year on 4-Jan-2023, the $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD. The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.\\n\\n#### Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team\u2019s address.\\n\\nAlthough it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract.\\nOn the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. \\n\\n#### YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scammed users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.\\nTwo days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.\\n\\nIn order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user\u2019s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.\\n\\nThe new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract\u2019s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.\\n\\n#### LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.\\n\\nThe reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. \\n\\nBased on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer\u2019s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.\\n\\nThen on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project\u2019s back end system.\\n\\nThe administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. \\n\\nThen the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.\\n\\nThen the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).\\n\\n\\n#### DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.\\n\\nThe issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts. However, it is undeniable that 2023 H1 has proven to be a challenging year for both investors and developers due to the continued bear market trend and exploit incidents. Below we have some final advice for investors and developers:\\n\\nFor investors:\\n\\n- Understand what you\'re signing, do not blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)\\n- Always double check that you are on the official website of the dApp\\n- Be wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team\u2019s authenticity\\n- Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)\\n- Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done\\n- Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet) \\n  If _High Risk_ is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away\\n\\n**Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!**\\n\\nFor developers:\\n\\n- Verify & open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)\\n- Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)\\n- Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure\\n- Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases\\n- Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations\\n- Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary\\n- Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)\\n- Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)\\n- Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token\\n\\n#### Hashdit\\n\\nHashDit\u2019s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors, helping them to make informed decisions.

Most of these advancements were made possible by improving the computational power of computers.\\n\\n\\n|                                |                                                                                                |\\n| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| ![](image/IAS.jpeg)            | ![](image/EVM.jpg)                                                                             | This is the text that will appear next to the images. |\\n| [First Von-Neuman Machine)[1]] | [Blockchain Virtual Machine[2]](https://decbc.com/blog/glossary/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/) |\\n\\n\\nWhile our current decentralized virtual machine on the blockchain is slow, expensive, and transparent, it still garners great attention and interest due to its trustworthy properties. If the computational power of the blockchain virtual machine were to be massively improved, it\'s believed that a huge evolution would come. This is where interesting cryptography schemes like \\"interactive proof\\" and \\"zero knowledge proof\\" come into play. They could significantly contribute to improving the computational power of the blockchain virtual machine and pave the way for even more exciting applications in the future.\\n\\nIn addition to ensuring the integrity of data, the consensus mechanism in blockchain does not provide any confidentiality guarantees by default. However, by using advanced cryptography techniques, such as zero knowledge proofs, confidentiality can be achieved on the blockchain virtual machine. Zero knowledge proof is an essential cryptographic tool that can help protect sensitive information on the blockchain, ensuring that only authorized parties have access to it. With zero knowledge proofs, the confidentiality of data is maintained, while still preserving the transparency and security of the blockchain network.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Interactive Proof vs Zero knowledge Proof\\nIn the exciting and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, you might come across the abbreviation \\"ZK\\". Typically, this refers to \\"zero knowledge\\", which is often associated with something called \\"zero knowledge proofs\\". However, it\'s important to note that in some cases, \\"ZK\\" might actually stand for \\"interactive proofs\\". This can be confusing for those who aren\'t familiar with the difference between the two.\\n\\nTo provide a concrete illustration of the concept, consider the following scenario: Imagine that you make a claim to your friend that you possess the ability to differentiate the two faces of any coin. To put your assertion to the test, your friend hands you a random coin and asks you to demonstrate your ability by describing how you differentiate the two faces. After several rounds of this exercise, your friend becomes convinced that you possess the ability to distinguish the two sides of a coin.\\n\\nIn this example, your friend serves as the verifier, seeking to determine whether your claim of coin differentiation is genuine. You, on the other hand, act as the prover, seeking to convince your friend of your ability without revealing the details of your method. This scenario resembles an interactive proof, in which the verifier challenges the prover to demonstrate their knowledge, and the prover responds with evidence that satisfies the verifier\'s demands.\\n\\nOn the other hand, zero knowledge proofs are a little different. This time you do not want to reveal how you differentiate the two faces. In this case, you and your friend both know the initial state of the coin, and you turn away while your friend decides whether to flip the coin or leave it in its current state. When you turn back, your friend asks you whether or not the coin has been flipped. If you can consistently answer correctly, your friend becomes convinced of your ability to differentiate the two faces of the coin.\\n\\n\\n|                   |                      |\\n| ----------------- | -------------------- |\\n| ![](image/IP.png) | ![](image/ZKP.png)   | This is the text that will appear next to the images. |\\n| Interactive Proof | Zero Knowledge Proof |\\n\\nSo, the next time you see \\"ZK\\" in the world of cryptocurrency, remember that it might refer to either zero knowledge proofs or interactive proofs. While they\'re both important concepts in cryptography, they\'re not quite the same thing!\\n\\nAnother commonly seen fascinating term is **SNARK** (Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge), which can be broadly understood as those zero knowledge proofs with cheap communication and computational cost for the verifier. Do you know what \\"zk-SNARK\\" means? Yes, you are right - it refers to SNARK with zero knowledge properties. For further elaboration, the zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) protocol embodies the following characteristics:\\n\\n- Zero-Knowledge: The proof does not reveal any information about the knowledge itself.\\n- Non-interactive: The proof can be conveyed in a single message from the prover to the verifier, eliminating the need for back-and-forth interaction.\\n- Argument: The interaction between the prover and verifier is limited, consisting of only a few rounds and minimal communication cost.\\n- Knowledge: The proof demonstrates that the prover possesses certain knowledge or information, without revealing the information itself.\\n\\nTogether, these features make zk-SNARKs a powerful tool for verifying the authenticity and validity of claims, while preserving the privacy and security of sensitive information. \\n\\n## Interactive Proof/SNARK in Blockchain\\nSmart contracts provide a trusted computing solution where they execute exactly as programmed, and the results cannot be tampered with by any party. However, this process can be slow and costly in some cases. In such situations, it may be more efficient to verify answers rather than computing/searching by themselves. Interactive proof can be used in the blockchain virtual machine to achieve faster computation and reduce costs. The smart contract includes a trusted verification function for incoming advice, and untrusted machines prove the validity of the computation to the verifier on-chain.\\n### 1. SNARK improves scalability\\nBlockchain technology has been gaining a lot of attention due to its decentralized and immutable nature. However, one of the major challenges of blockchain is scalability. As more users join the network and more transactions are added, the processing time and costs increase exponentially. This can lead to a slow and expensive network, which is not practical for mass adoption.\\n\\nSNARK helps reduce the transaction size by compressing the amount of data required for verification. In a traditional blockchain system, each transaction is accompanied by a set of data, including the public key of the sender, the signature, and the hash value. This data is required to verify the validity of the transaction.\\n\\nHowever, with SNARK, the transaction data can be compressed into a shorter proof. The proof is then used to verify the transaction, instead of the full data set. This makes the transaction much smaller in size, as only the proof needs to be stored on the blockchain.\\n\\nBy reducing the transaction size, SNARK helps improve the scalability of blockchain. As more transactions can be processed in a shorter amount of time, the overall speed and efficiency of the network is improved.\\n\\nMoreover, smaller transactions also mean lower transaction fees, making the network more accessible to a wider range of users. This can further drive adoption and increase the value of the blockchain network.\\n\\n### 2. SNARK on Layer2 blockchain\\nLayer 2 solutions are a popular approach for scaling blockchain technology. These solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and are designed to improve the speed and efficiency of transactions. One such solution is the use of sidechains or state channels. However, to ensure the security and privacy of the underlying data, these solutions require a robust proof system. SNARK is one such technology that can help to achieve this goal.\\n\\n![](image/layer2.png)\\n\\n\\nIn a sidechain implementation, SNARK technology generates proofs that validate transactions on the sidechain, without revealing the underlying data. These proofs are then sent back to the main blockchain to ensure the transactions are accurate and valid. This approach helps to reduce the load on the main blockchain, allowing for a greater number of transactions to be processed.\\n\\nSimilarly, in state channel implementations, SNARK can be used to create a trustless channel between two parties. This enables them to conduct multiple transactions off-chain, reducing the number of transactions that need to be processed on the main blockchain. The channel is secured by a deposit held on the main blockchain, and SNARK is used to generate proofs of the transactions, which can be verified by the main blockchain at any time.\\n## ZKP/zk-SNARK in Blockchain\\n\\nZKP plays a crucial role in enhancing the privacy and security of blockchain networks and many contributors on this new field to enhance the privacy of Web3.0 with ZKP.\\nIn overview here are some ways ZKP is used in blockchain:\\n\\n### 1. Identity Verification\\nIn a blockchain network, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) can be used to confirm a user\'s identity without disclosing any personal information. This is especially valuable in decentralized systems, where anonymity is essential.\\n\\nConsider this scenario: Alice needs to prove that she is over 18 years old to a third party, but she doesn\'t want to reveal her actual age or any other sensitive information. Typically, Alice would have to show some form of identification that includes her age and potentially other personal details. However, with ZKPs, Alice can demonstrate her age without compromising her privacy.\\n\\nHere\'s how it works: Alice creates a unique digital identity on the blockchain network and generates a ZKP that verifies she is over 18 without revealing her exact age. Alice and the third party engage in a series of interactive computations that demonstrate her age is greater than 18. The third party can then verify the accuracy of the proof without learning Alice\'s actual age or any other personal information.\\n\\nThis approach to identity verification is highly relevant in industries such as finance, healthcare, and voting where privacy and security are crucial. By using ZKPs, individuals can safeguard their personal information while still proving their identity to third parties.\\n### 2. Zero Knowledge Transaction Verification\\nZKP can also be used to verify the validity of a transaction without revealing any sensitive information about the transaction. This is particularly useful in financial transactions, where privacy is a top concern. ZKP can be used to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing the amount or the parties involved. Recall that zero knowledge proof is interactive proof with zero knowledge properties, it\'s the in the same manner as the interactive proof for transaction verification but with confidentiality guaranteed.\\n\\n### 3. Verifiable Random Function\\nVerifiable Random Functions (VRF) are cryptographic functions that produce random outputs while providing a proof that the output is truly random. ZKP can be used to create a VRF that provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent system, ideal for various cryptographic applications.\\n\\nThe VRF is generated using a secret key and a seed value. The ZKP generates a short proof that the VRF output is based on the seed and the secret key, without revealing any information about either value. This proof can then be used to verify the randomness of the VRF output, without requiring the verification party to know the secret key or the seed value.\\n\\nThe use of ZKP in VRF ensures that the output is random, non-predictable, and fair, making it an ideal solution for various use cases, including blockchain-based systems, where fairness and security are essential.\\n\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, ZKP is a powerful tool for enhancing the privacy and security of blockchain networks. It enables blockchain networks to verify identities, transactions, and smart contracts without revealing any sensitive information. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, ZKP is expected to play an increasingly important role in ensuring the privacy and security of these networks."},{"id":"smart-wallet-migration-guide","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/smart-wallet-migration-guide","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-07/2023-01-07.md","title":"Multisig Wallet Migration Guide","description":"Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?","date":"2023-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"smart-contract-security","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/smart-contract-security"},{"label":"standards","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/standards"},{"label":"security best practices","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/security-best-practices"},{"label":"crypto wallets","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/crypto-wallets"},{"label":"smart wallets","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/smart-wallets"},{"label":"migrate","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/migrate"},{"label":"multisig","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/multisig"},{"label":"multi-signature","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/multi-signature"}],"readingTime":9.68,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Himura K.","title":"SCS@HashDit","key":"Himura K"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"smart-wallet-migration-guide","title":"Multisig Wallet Migration Guide","authors":["Himura K"],"tags":["smart-contract-security","standards","security best practices","crypto wallets","smart wallets","migrate","multisig","multi-signature"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Zero-Knowledge Proof and Its Application in Blockchain","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-and-its-application-in-blockchain"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Risks and Future of Crypto Wallets","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/The-risks-and-future-of-crypto-wallets"}},"content":"## Smart Contract Wallets, the Future of Crypto Wallets?\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;Multi-signature wallets, also referred to as multisig wallets, are standardized smart contracts that consolidate multiple accounts and private keys into a single wallet for managing crypto assets. The main goal of a multisig wallet is to create redundancy by requiring multiple private key signatures to authorize a transaction, similar to other crypto wallet solutions. Smart wallets utilize a group of exclusive key pairs and wallet owners can set the minimum number of signatures required for authorizing any transaction, allowing them to distribute the keys associated with the primary wallet to other parties and decentralize the responsibility of managing funds. As a result, multiple parties must sign off on a transaction before it is validated, providing an extra layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets associated with it. This mechanism also prevents malicious actors from accessing funds if one of the accounts private keys is lost or stolen.\\n\\n&emsp;To learn more about the risks associated with traditional crypto wallets and to get a comprehensive technical analysis of the benefits of using a multisig wallet, please check out our article, [The Risk and Future of Crypto Wallets](https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/The-risks-and-future-of-crypto-wallets/). In this article, we compare MPC Wallet and Smart Wallets and explain which one is preferable from a security perspective. As crypto wallets are a critical component in a blockchain system, it is crucial to establish robust policies, guidelines, and best practices to safeguard and benefit the entire community.\\n\\n&emsp;That\'s why we\'ve created a guide on how to migrate from a conventional wallet to a multisig solution. Since crypto wallets are a single point of failure, we recommend transitioning to smart wallets to reduce the impact if one of the private keys is intentionally or accidentally leaked. Additionally, this significantly diminishes the likelihood of former employees attacking the protocol in case of an inside job.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## How to Migrate to a Smart Wallet\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;This guide outlines the process of migrating your wallets to a secure multisig wallet using Gnosis Safe and Trust Wallet.

Additionally, we strongly advise projects with simple crypto wallets that have elevated privileges in their decentralized applications to switch to a multisig solution. If your project has any roles with elevated privileges in its smart contracts, it is essential to migrate all the wallets from classic to multisig setups. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Gnosis Safe and Trust Wallet to manage the Safe. However, before considering migrating your smart contracts to a multisig solution, ensure that your project complies with the following requirements:\\n\\n&emsp;Make sure your smart contracts have a mechanism to change the addresses with elevated roles. For instance, if your smart contract is using the Ownable interface, one might be able to use the contract function [transferOwnership](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-) to transfer the ownership between addresses - in this case from an External Owned Address (EOA) to the multisig wallet. If your contract does not have this capability to change a role address, we suggest adding such capability to a new version of your smart contract and upgrading it.

But different from traditional wallets, no crypto assets are stored in them. Crypto wallets, however, are composed of a public key that is associated with the wallet\'s public address used to send someone crypto assets. and, private keys, which are necessary to access and manage the associated assets. Crypto assets stay on chain, their smart contract state changes to reflect the changing of owners.\\n\\n&emsp;Crypto wallets are the first component a new user has to start learning. And they are fundamental for anyone wanting to interact with crypto assets, decentralized applications (Dapps) - in Decentralized Finance, Non-Fungible Tokens, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, etc.\\n\\n&emsp;Even if under the hood, crypto wallets rely on the usage of secure asymmetric cryptographic keys, managing such keys has always been a security challenge in the IT industry. Over the years, asymmetric keys have been used to secure communications between parties, by ensuring message confidentiality and are heavily used to secure internet communications between browsers and servers, with the famous HTTPS standard.\\n\\n![www secure communications](./secure_www.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\">\\n<i>Figure 1</i>: <u>Worldwide secure communication with TLS and HTTPS.</u>\\n</div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\n&emsp;Now, cryptographic keys have the challenge of securing crypto assets. This is a completely new use case that presents more risks than using public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure messages between parties over the internet. The financial impacts cannot be compared. Instead of being stored securely in Hardware Security Module (HSM), managed by a Key Management System secured by cloud providers with years of experience and a team of experts, crypto wallets can now be stored in a browser plugin, in a web app, mobile app or in a desktop app. Lot of relevant characteristics exist for crypto wallets: are they hot wallets, cold wallets, paper wallets, or hardware wallets? Do they implement hierarchical deterministic standards, are they blockchain-specific, multi-chain? Are they self-custody or 3rd party custody? With all these questions, arise security concerns that we are not addressing in the article.\\n\\n&emsp;Mismanaging crypto private keys has been a common cause of loss of funds for investors and a reason for Dapps to be hacked. In the long run, this becomes a major problem for wide crypto adoption. Especially when compared with today\'s banking system security and user experience.\\n\\n&emsp;So far, the Web3 industry has been getting inspiration from the IT industry\'s best practices, when considering the public key infrastructure. However, is it enough? Should the Web3 industry create new standards dedicated to such use cases?\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Crypto Wallets and Single Point of Failure (SPOF)\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;However, the usage of public keys to managing assets associated with a crypto wallet is unfortunately risky. Indeed, the seed phrase and the private keys become a central security element that can put all the funds associated at risk. In this article, we are further evaluating the risks associated with the loss or the theft/leak of private keys.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Loss of Seed Phrases and Private Keys\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp; If a private key or a seed phrase is lost, users are not able to access their crypto assets. According to Chainalysis, 20% or $140 billion dollars of all bitcoins are lost. Many stories of users that lost their wallet password, or the hard drive containing the wallets, seed phrases, and hardware wallets. Once keys are lost, by design, for asymmetric cryptographic keys to be secure, it is impossible to regenerate the private key. Therefore, funds are lost forever.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Stolen or Leaked Private Keys and Seed Phrases\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;Similarly, if these sensitive pieces of information are stolen, malicious actors get full control of one\'s assets. The most common and most effective type of attacks in the crypto industry is the usage of social engineering attacks, phishing and scams are still the most profitable ways to steal crypto assets because they are single and rapid to be put into place, one only need to build a fake website pretending to be real Web3 projects, or fake wallet application that steal the data one inadvertently shares with them. In many cases, such malicious applications request seed phrases or private keys, which should never be shared - only if one migrates their wallet\u2019s private keys to another wallet provider. To summarize, as a user or investor, it just requires a small amount of inattention for one to click a malicious link and interact with the underlying application for them to lose part of all of their crypto assets.\\n\\n&emsp;For projects, it becomes a real problem to manage a considerable amount of crypto assets. The project is only as secure as their less secure link. Not only are they susceptible to phishing attacks, but also, to hacks and sometimes internal jobs or an employee who went rogue that could be covered as hacks.\\n\\n&emsp;Note: If one discovers, their private keys or seed phrases have been compromised, they should move any remaining assets to a new safe wallet as soon as possible!\\n\\n&emsp;This is why we consider crypto wallets a single point of failure. A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails, causes the entire system (Decentralized application or wallet) to fail. It is a critical component or a bottleneck that, if it becomes unavailable, causes the system to be unavailable as well. It is important to identify and mitigate single points of failure in order to increase the reliability and availability of a system.\\n\\n&emsp;In a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, a single point of failure can exist if the private key associated with a particular public key is lost or compromised.\\n\\n&emsp;So let\u2019s consider the classic dilemma in the web3 ecosystem: \u201cNot your crypto, not your coins\u201d - the dilemma between self-custody such as hardware wallets, and third-party custody, such as in exchanges. On the one hand, one should take full ownership of managing their crypto wallets, using, storing, and securing them on their own. They would be subjected to the existing risk of losing or mismanaging them. On the other hand, some users would rather delegate the management of their crypto wallet to a third party that is specialized in the matter. This is a valid debate.\\n\\n![Self custody](./self_custody.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<i>Figure 2</i>: <u>Ledger self-custody hardware wallet.</u>\\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n&emsp;It is important however for every end-user to understand the risks associated with the management of crypto wallets. But when thinking of mass adoption, there is always a community that would rather pay not to have to waste time or to worry about the risks and responsibility that it is to securely manage their crypto life savings. Such groups would rather rely on a trusted third-party entity to do it for them. Similar to what we have done over the years with banks and insurance.\\n\\n![3rd party custody illustraction](./3rd_party_custody.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<i>Figure 3</i>: <u>Illustration of a third-party custody safe.</u>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n&emsp;However, in this article, we are not evaluating the many practical and philosophical pros and cons of each one of the options and are limiting ourselves to mentioning that each option implies a very different level of responsibilities and requires different levels of expertise in cybersecurity, in general. Self-custody, with today\u2019s technology, is still risky even for individuals with technical knowledge.\\n\\n&emsp;But, many solutions are in place to address the single point of failure problem and enable a more secure self-custody experience for users and web3 projects. So let\u2019s discover the solutions.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## The Secure Future of Crypto Wallets\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;To mitigate the risks of a single point of failure in PKI, over the years organizations have created securities policies and best practices gathered in security frameworks such as the ISO/IEC 27099. In such a framework, some of the guidelines suggest the implementation of robust key management protocols in combination with HSMs, as well as regular testing and monitoring of these systems for vulnerabilities. This includes implementing measures such as backups and redundant solutions to ensure that the system remains functional in the event of a key management failure, at the software and hardware level.\\n\\n&emsp;However, the crypto space has changed the way we use public key infrastructure. Now, the new practice is to use it for managing crypto assets. And PKI\'s traditional policies and procedures did not take into account the usage of such mechanisms for crypto asset management. The web3 industry had to develop solutions for this new use case of asymmetric keys being used as wallets.\\n\\n&emsp;Thanks to cryptographic techniques such as signature verification, multi-party computing (MPC), and smart contracts technology, two new solutions are being considered the future of crypto wallets because of their ease of use, flexibility, security, control, compatibility with current existing solutions while addressing the problems of a single point of failure. On the one hand, there are the Multi-party Computation Wallets and the Smart Wallets, also known as multi-signature (multisig) wallets.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Multi-Party Computation Wallets\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n&emsp;Firstly, multi-party computation (MPC) wallets are crypto asset wallets that can use MPC cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, or oblivious transfer. The goal of such solutions is to enable different parties to manage one private key and the assets associated with it, without one single participant knowing the whole private key. This means, not a single entity knows the private key on his own, which prevents them from accessing the funds.\\n\\n&emsp;Such particularity makes an MPC wallet a tool for creating a shared crypto account, with family members or with your business partners. MPC wallets help in introducing trust when required to manage crypto assets together.\\n\\n&emsp;MPC wallets are still in their early days, mainly because (secure) multi-party computation is still an evolving field in cryptographic and should still evolve in the next few years with great new techniques.\\n\\nHere are some of the MPC <b>advantages</b>:\\n\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Off-chain recovery.</li>\\n    <li>Chain agnostic.</li>\\n    <li>No gas overhead.</li>\\n    <li>No need for change in Dapp for integration.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nSome of the <b>drawbacks</b> are:\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Early stage technology, libraries implementations, which is not great from a security point of view because they can have undetected vulnerabilities.</li>\\n<li>Immutability and lack of redundancy - once created, one cannot change the signers of the associated wallets. In case one loses their wallet, all the funds stored in the MPC will stay blocked.</li>\\n<li>All wallets associated with it have to sign. There is no m-over-n signature architecture.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n### Smart Wallets\\n\\n&emsp;Secondly, smart (contract) wallets or multisig wallets have been used and battle-tested for longer. Indeed, they are smart contracts deployed on chains and publicly available for anyone to verify. With smart wallets, similarly to MPC wallets, it is possible for a group of individuals to manage together crypto assets associated with the main smart wallet.\\n\\n&emsp;Multisig wallet owners are able to set up the minimum number of signatures required for the wallet to validate and authorize transactions. This allows them to distribute the keys associated with the main wallet account to other parties, decentralizing the responsibility of managing the funds of a project and creating redundancy.\\n\\n&emsp;Practically speaking, to authorize a transaction multiple parties have to read and validate the transaction before it can be taken into account. Thanks to this mechanism, if one of the private keys is lost or stolen, a malicious actor will not be able to access the funds without the other wallet owners. And they are notified someone is performing a suspicious transaction that can be confirmed directly with other key managers. Such a mechanism provides an additional layer of security for the wallet and the crypto assets it holds.\\n\\n&emsp;Multisig wallets are important for individual users who want to keep ownership of their crypto assets. This helps solve the problem of lost hard drives where crypto wallets or seed phrases were stored. If one gets lost, they still can manage the funds and reconfigure the multisig and remove the lost key and add a new one.\\n\\n![2 of 3 Multisig Wallet](./multisig.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<i>Figure 4</i>: <u>2 of 3 Multi-Signature wallet.</u>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n&emsp;Additionally, multisig wallets can provide an additional layer of security for organizations or groups such as DAO that hold large amounts of crypto assets. By requiring multiple signatures for transactions, multisig wallets can help to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the funds. One of the main actors that can benefit from multisig wallets is the web3 projects. In recent history, many hacks such as The AscenDex hack as well as the Ankr protocol hack happened because of leaked/stolen private keys. These two projects suffered major financial losses severely impacting not only the project financials but their partners and the trust placed in them by the users, investors, and the community. Multi-sig could become a new standard.\\n\\n&emsp;Multi sig has also a very interesting added value. From the perspective of web3 projects and protocols: The increasing number of smart contracts in a decentralized application and the increasing complexity of their architecture and interactions, it becomes fundamental to provide transparency and visibility on key performance indicators such as the usage of a secure crypto wallet. They fulfill two main roles: managing crypto assets, but also performing important actions in decentralized applications such as updating the smart contract, pausing a protocol, changing the fees, etc.\\n\\n&emsp;Such information is relevant not only for web3 projects\' internal security and monitoring but also to increase trust between them and business partners, customers and investors. Since the blockchain is a single source of truth, all the stakeholders can easily verify the security measure on the chain,\\n\\n![Observability and Monitoring](./monitoring.jpeg)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<i>Figure 5</i>: <u>Observability and Monitoring.</u>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n&emsp; Smart wallets are one of the most advanced security solutions for managing crypto wallets for projects to allow anyone to certify they are using proper security measures to protect their applications and as a consequence, protect their users, their business partners, and their community.\\n\\nSmart wallets are quite versatile, enabling more features, and here are a few of them:\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timelock - prevent spending before a certain date.</li>\\n<li>Spending limits.</li>\\n<li>Mutability, add and remove keys or signers after the wallet is set up.</li>\\n<li>Gas abstractions and pay for fees with other tokens than network tokens.</li>\\n<li>Transaction batching.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nSome of the <b>drawbacks</b> are:\\n\\n<ul>\\n    <li>The overhead for the multi-wallet creation is about 30-40.000 gas and an additional 2.000 gas on the subsequent ones.</li>\\n    <li>Requires Dapp adoption of the EIP 1271 standard.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Conclusion on the Security Perspective.\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n&emsp;MPC and Smart Wallets are the future technologies for crypto wallets even if MPC and its cryptographic technologies are still being developed and standardized. Multisig, on the other hand, has been around for longer, and battle-tested and even hacked with the Parity Multisig Hack which made projects put more effort into smart wallet security. Both types of wallets create redundancy to prevent the mismanagement of funds by one user.\\n\\n&emsp;Even if MPC wallets display a simpler and off-chain process for wallet creation and recovery, being a little cheaper to use and more compatible with decentralized applications, they lack flexibility once they are created. Losing any of the keys required to sign a transaction prevents the parties from accessing the wallet\'s funds. Smart wallets on the other hand are more flexible, users can be added or removed from the multisig wallet, and keys can be rotated, which is important in case of a security breach or a lost key. Finally, because they are smart contracts, they can implement very different functional features such as paying limits, lack of funds, and others.\\n\\n&emsp;We prefer Multi-signature wallets over other options such as multi-party computation wallets because the latter cannot be easily identified nor audited on-chain. Any project user, business partner, or investor can verify on the chain they are using security best practices to reduce the risks associated with a compromised private key be it an internal job or an external hack, it just makes the whole system more redundant and resilient.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"bsc-2022-end-of-year-report","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/bsc-2022-end-of-year-report","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-26/2022-12-26.md","title":"2022 End of Year BSC Security Report","description":"Overview","date":"2022-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"smart-contract-security","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/smart-contract-security"},{"label":"end-of-year-report","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/end-of-year-report"},{"label":"bsc","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/bsc"},{"label":"2022","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/tags/2022"}],"readingTime":22.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lim","title":"SCS@HashDit","url":"https://github.com/slim115","imageURL":"https://github.com/slim115.png","key":"Sebastian"},{"name":"Chris","title":"SCS@HashDit","key":"Chris"},{"name":"Himura K.","title":"SCS@HashDit","key":"Himura K"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bsc-2022-end-of-year-report","title":"2022 End of Year BSC Security Report","authors":["Sebastian","Chris","Himura K"],"tags":["smart-contract-security","end-of-year-report","bsc","2022"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The Risks and Future of Crypto Wallets","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/The-risks-and-future-of-crypto-wallets"},"nextItem":{"title":"Repackaged Apps are harmful","permalink":"/hashdit/blog/repackaged-apps-are-harmful"}},"content":"### Overview\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThis report focuses on security events that happened on BSC in 2022, analyzing the type of projects targeted and sharing the common attack techniques used in 2022, with respect to the financial loss of the incidents.\\n\\nThis report also examines the trends on BSC from 2020 to 2022 to help give readers a better understanding of how the space has grown.

Despite the general cryptocurrency bear market and black swan events like [Luna](https://vulcanpost.com/791820/terra-luna-timeline-how-crash-revival-plan/) and [FTX](https://www.investopedia.com/what-went-wrong-with-ftx-6828447), BSC has continued to reach new milestones and surpass expectations.\\n\\nHere is a list of some of BSC\u2019s achievements in 2022: [Refer to the [blog](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/bnb-chain-enjoys-significant-growth-in-2022-despite-crypto-winter/) released by BNBChain for more information]\\n\\n- $1 billion growth [fund](https://www.bsc.news/post/bsc-releases-areas-of-investment-focus-for-its-1-billion-growth-fund)\\n- [AvengerDAO](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/introducing-avengerdao-the-security-initiative-protecting-users-from-malicious-actors/) Launch\\n- Implement [Liquidity Staking](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/30/bnb-chain-introduces-liquid-staking-to-provide-crypto-users-access-to-additional-income-streams/) on BSC and [Binance Account-Based](https://www.binance.com/en/BABT) (BAB) tokens\\n- OpenSea incorporates [BSC](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/29/opensea-adds-support-for-bnb-chain-nfts/)\\n- [zkBNB](https://www.cryptotimes.io/bnb-chain-unveils-zero-knowledge-proof-scaling-tech-zkbnb/) launched on Testnet\\n- Unique addresses crossed **234 million**.

However, due to BSC\u2019s decentralization nature and its fast growth to more than 1200 DApps, more bad actors have been attracted to the space as well. As such, security incidents have generally been on a rising trend.\\n\\nThis section aims to describe the security incidents YoY from 2020 to 2022.\\n\\n#### General\\n\\nAccording to our statistics, in 2022, there were 282 security incidents on BSC which have increased by 228% YoY from 2021. In 2021, there were 86 security incidents, a 760% increase from 2020.\\n\\n![IMG-3](./no_of_incidents.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 3: Number of incidents on the BNB Smart Chain over the last 3 years\\n</p>\\n\\nFinancial losses have also increased from 2020 to 2022, with damages totalling $1.81 billion over the past 3 years, as seen from the chart below. The YoY increase from 2020 to 2021 is 61,221%, while the YoY increase from 2021 to 2022 is 37%, a large decline in YoY percentage.\\n\\n![IMG-4](./fiat_loss_yoy.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 4: Total amount stolen funds in dollars in the BNB Smart Chain over the last 3 years\\n</p>\\n\\nBy analyzing the ratio of the <ins>total amount of stolen funds</ins> to the <ins>total number of incidents</ins>, we observed that the <ins>average of stolen funds per incident</ins> has decreased.\\n\\nIndeed, in 2021, the average of stolen funds per incident was calculated to be $8.9m. In contrast, in 2022, this value dropped to just $3.7m - even when there were several considerable events that represent almost half of the stolen funds. This shows that the number of security exploits with high financial impact is decreasing. Such decrease could be explained by the fact that projects with important funds are better secured and are more battle-tested. As such, malicious actors seem to be focusing their efforts on projects with more modest funds, concluding in lesser value exploits.\\n\\nThis pie chart shows a better understanding of the financial losses over the year with 2022 accounting for 57.84% of the total financial loss across, 2021 being 42.10% and 2020 with a mere 0.07%.\\n\\n![IMG-5](./financial_loss_annual.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 5: Financial losses in % over the last 3 years\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Type of attack vectors\\n\\nAccording to our statistics, this is the breakdown of the general attack vectors from 2020 - 2022.\\n\\n![IMG-6](./general_attack_type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 6: Number of incidents per attack vector over the last 3 years\\n</p>\\n\\nIt can be seen that crypto scams (in green) are a growing concern on the BSC, with 167 in 2022, a 328% increase YoY. Also, there were 2 counts of improper management incidents in 2022, which were never accounted for previously. This seems to suggest that project parties might not be following the best practices in securing user funds. When managing critical components such as team wallets\u2019 private keys, it is important to use a secure management system.\\n\\nDo stay tuned to our [blogs](https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog) if you are interested in best practice guides for securing your Web3 project.\\n\\n#### Type of projects\\n\\nThis chart represents the type of projects that were exploited since 2020.\\n![IMG-7](./project_type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 7: Security Incidents per type of project over the last 3 years\\n</p>\\n\\nIt is clear that DeFi projects are still the main targets for crypto hackers, with 208 in 2022, a 147% increase from 2021.\\n\\nBridge and GameFi projects were the only other projects which encountered security incidents in 2021, besides DeFi projects. In total, 9 Bridge and 19 GameFi projects were exploited, a 800% and 1800% increase respectively from 2021.\\n\\nWith the expansion of the BSC ecosystem, other categories of projects came into the limelight such as ExerciseFi and SocialFi, which did not exist back in 2021. Some of these projects were victims of hacks as well.\\n\\n### 2022 in focus\\n\\n#### General\\n\\nIn total, nearly $1.05 billion were lost to security incidents on BSC. By observing the monthly chart below, the months with the top amount loss were October, January followed by June.\\n\\n![IMG-8](./fiat_loss.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 8: Amount of stolen funds in dollars per month in 2022\\n</p>\\n\\nIn those months, the main contributing incidents were (1) BSC token hub exploit, (2) Qubit exploit, and lastly the (3) EvoDefi bridge mismanagement incident.\\n\\nInterestingly, when removing these 3 outlier incidents from the chart, the total financial loss drops down to just $346.9m, a staggering 67% drop or one-third of total amount loss of 2022. Also, the average of stolen funds per incident falls to $1.2m, from the $3.7m value shared earlier in the report.\\n\\n![IMG-9](./special_charts_1.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 9: Amount of stolen funds in dollars excluding the 3 largest incidents\\n</p>\\n\\nThis chart is closely correlated to the number of security incidents monthly in 2022.\\n\\n![IMG-10](<./no_of_incidents(1).png>)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 10: Number of different project impacted by exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nFor example, the highest number of security incidents took place in October which is in line with the highest amount of loss.\\n\\nHowever, months that have a higher number of security incidents might have a low amount of loss too. For example, even though August has 29 security incidents which is above the monthly average (23), the financial loss for that month is only $8m which is the 2nd lowest throughout the year. Such data reinforces the fact that we are seeing more incidents with lesser financial impact.\\n\\n#### Type of attack vectors\\n\\nOut of the 282 security incidents, crypto scams are the most common on the BNB Chain as shown below, 62.06% of security incidents are crypto scams, followed by 37.23% being hacks and 0.71% being improper management such as mismanagement of private keys.\\n\\n![IMG-11](./Attack_method_number_of_incidents.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 11: Proportion of different type of exploits\\n</p>\\n\\nHowever, it is interesting to note that even when the number of scams are nearly double of hacks, the financial impact of scams are less significant than the ones related to the hacks. The total financial loss of scams ($190m) is less than half of the loss to hacks ($803m), as shown below in Figure 12.\\n\\n![IMG-12](./financial_loss_per_general_attack_type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 12: Financial impact measured in dollars comparing different types of incidents\\n</p>\\n\\nFor further analysis of the specific attack vectors, this chart displays this against the financial loss in 2022.\\n\\n![IMG-13](./financial_loss_per_specific_attack_type.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 13: Proportion of the funds lost comparing the different type of vulnerabilities\\n</p>\\n\\n32.93% attributes to the BSC token hub exploit incident where there was a low level vulnerability, specifically an [IAVL](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/iavl) tree related verification bug. The 2nd largest contributor was Business Logic Vulnerabilities within smart contracts deployed on BSC, accounting for 29.45%.\\n\\nIt is notable here that \u201clow-level\u201d scams like Rugpull and Ponzi, even though they are the most common, do not take up much of the proportion as seen in the pie chart.\\n\\n#### Type of projects\\n\\nWhen focusing on the project type vs financial loss, without surprise, 60.38% of financial loss are attributed to Bridge projects. This is because cross-chain bridges generally lock large amounts of crypto assets on one chain to mint collateralized assets on the destination chain. Hackers took notice of this trend and targeted vulnerabilities within these cross-chain bridge smart contracts.\\n\\nThe 2nd most project type targeted was DeFi projects at 37.06%, followed by GameFi and Metaverse projects at 1.22% and 1.08% respectively.\\n\\n![IMG-14](./financial_loss_per_project_type_distribution.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 14: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project \\n</p>\\n\\n#### Top 10 incidents in 2022\\n\\nThe following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial loss in 2022.\\n\\n![IMG-15](./top_10_incidents_bsc.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\nFigure 15: Top exploits measured in dollars in 2022 on the BNB Smart Chain\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Top 10 incidents in 2022\\n\\n##### BSC Token Hub exploit - $572 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 6th October 2022, BSC Token hub, a bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain and the BNB Smart Chain, was exploited by an attacker resulting in the unauthorized transfer of 2M BNB.\\n\\nRoot cause analysis confirmed a flaw in the verification algorithm implementation developed by Cosmos, and incorporated by BSC into their contract\u2019s proof verification process. Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn\u2019t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.\\n\\n##### QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.\\n\\nRoot cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).\\n\\nThe legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.\\n\\n##### EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss\\n\\nThe team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) & Polygon, invested users\u2019 funds on Terra\u2019s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.\\n\\nHowever, due to the collapse of Terra\u2019s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.\\n\\nThus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users\u2019 funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund\u2019s value.\\n\\n##### StableFund - $23 Million Loss\\n\\nStableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.\\n\\nIn reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.\\n\\nThe project started from 2022-06-27, where >13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.\\n\\n##### Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.\\n\\nThe root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.\\n\\n##### Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for > $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users\u2019 wallets to the unknown exploiter\u2019s address.\\n\\nThankfully, > $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).\\n\\nThe root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.\\n\\n##### ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for > $15m, bringing the total damage to > $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.\\n\\nHelio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform\u2019s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.\\n\\n##### Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.\\n\\nFor Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.\\n\\nFor the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.\\n\\n##### $FLARE - $17 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the \\"balance\\" related data structure.\\n\\nThe project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this \u201cbalance\u201d related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.\\n\\nHowever, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.\\n\\n##### DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss\\n\\nOn 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m. The hacker compromised multiple private keys of the team. As a result, the hacker removed liquidity from the projects and stole all funds from their hot wallets. The funds have already been bridged to ETH chain and deposited into Tornado Cash.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transactions. However, it is undeniable that 2022 has proven to be a tough year for both investors and developers due to the bear market and hack incidents, which impeded trust within the cryptocurrency community. Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:\\n\\nFor investors:\\n\\n- Understand what you\'re signing, don\'t blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)\\n- Always double check that you are on the official website of the DApp\\n- Be extra wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team\u2019s authenticity\\n- Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)\\n- Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done\\n- Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)\\n  If _High Risk_ is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away\\n\\n**Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!**\\n\\nFor developers:\\n\\n- Verify & open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)\\n- Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)\\n- Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure\\n- Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases\\n- Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations\\n- Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary\\n- Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)\\n- Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)\\n- Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token\\n\\n#### Hashdit\\n\\nHashDit\u2019s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.

Happy new year to all!\\n\\n### Glossary\\n\\n#### General Incident classification\\n\\nThe type of incidents can be generally broken down into 3 types:\\n\\n- Hacks\\n\\n  - Hacks in general, is the practice of intentionally exploiting weaknesses in an organization\'s computer systems. In the context of blockchain, it is exploiting vulnerabilities in fundamental components of DApps and in the blockchain infrastructure. The non-exhaustive list of components can be: blockchain bridges, oracles, crypto wallets, Frontend/backend application and smart contracts which are deployed on-chain. Examples include business logic issues and lack of validation.\\n  - At times, it could be compromising the private keys of project teams through traditional attack vectors.\\n\\n- Scams\\n\\n  - Scams are Web3 projects that do not intend to deliver promised features. Indeed, they usually entice users to invest or participate in the project with the only intent of keeping their invested money and leaving the users hanging.\\n  - Scams could be executed by dumping tokens, stealing all the invested funds, through means like sending sketchy emails and websites, or creating fake accounts on social media. In the context of blockchain, scams can involve investing in a \u201cGet-rich-quick scheme\u201d such as a Ponzi scheme or tricking users into signing unintended transactions that will result in stolen funds.\\n\\n  - Do refer to our blog article for more details on the [top 6 crypto scams](https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/top-6-crypto-scams-2022/) in 2022.\\n\\n- Improper Management\\n  - Improper Management is a unique situation where the project party mismanages components that associate with user funds. Some examples include application misconfiguration issues that could expose critical information about users / project funds, or when the project party mints uncollateralized funds to perform high risk trading. This will be at the expense of users\u2019 funds being lost.\\n\\n#### Project type classification\\n\\n- Bridge\\n\\n  - A blockchain bridge is a tool that lets you port assets from one blockchain to another, solving one of the main pain points within blockchains \u2013 a lack of interoperability. Since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.\\n\\n- DeFi (Decentralized Finance)\\n\\n  - Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a new financial framework consisting of decentralized blockchain protocols and underlying smart contract technology. DeFi, as it is most commonly known, makes it possible for users to access different types of financial products and services without the need for a centralized authority.\\n\\n- GameFi (Play-to-Earn)\\n\\n  - \'GameFi\' refers to the financialisation of video gaming. It is characterized by its \'play-to-earn\' (P2E) business model, and mainly refers to blockchain games that offer tokenized incentives to players while enabling frameworks for player-as-owner rather than the standard player-as-consumer.\\n\\n- Learn-to-Earn\\n\\n  - \'Learn-to-Earn\u2019 refers to the financialisation of quizzing. It is characterized by the business model, which offers tokenized incentives to players who participate in the project and answer quizzes.\\n\\n- Metaverse\\n\\n  - Crypto metaverses are immersive virtual worlds with immense social and financial potential. Their use of blockchain infrastructure enables them to tap into the wider crypto economy, making virtual items exchangeable for real economic value beyond the confines of the metaverse.\\n\\n- SocialFi\\n\\n  - SocialFi is the fusion of social media and Web3. It refers to social media on a blockchain with a layer of finance in it. The concept brings together the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi) and social media to create, manage, and own content generated by the users on the platforms.\\n\\n- ExerciseFi\\n\\n  - ExerciseFi or Move-to-Earn as its name implies, users are rewarded for movement, whether walking, running or dancing to a rhythm.\\n\\n- Oracle\\n\\n  - Oracles are complex computerized systems that connect data from the outside world (off-chain) with the blockchain world (on-chain). Most blockchains have native cryptocurrencies that are used to transfer value, enable the operations of the protocol, or facilitate governance.\\n\\n- Wallet\\n\\n  - A Cryptocurrency Wallet is an application that functions as a wallet for your cryptocurrencies. It is called a wallet because it is used similarly to a wallet you put cash and cards in. Instead of holding these physical items, it stores the rivate keys you use to sign for your cryptocurrency transactions and provides the interface that lets you access and manage your cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n- DAO\\n  - A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure that has no central governing body and whose members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the entity.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"repackaged-apps-are-harmful","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/repackaged-apps-are-harmful","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-19/2022-12-19.md","title":"Repackaged Apps are harmful","description":"During the past years, Android strengthened its leadership among all mobile operating systems, with an average of approximately 70.96% of the market share.

One of the prevalent types of attack is something called repackaging. Repackaging refers to the practice of customizing an existing mobile app and redistributing it in the wild. Specifically, attackers modify a popular app downloaded from app markets, reverse-engineer the app, inject some malicious code, and redistribute the modified app. Because it is difficult for regular users to notice the difference between the repackaged app and the original app, victims may suffer financial loss, mainly when security-critical private and business apps they use, such as Crypto Exchange apps, are repackaged.\\n\\n## Repackaged Android Apps\\n\\nSome may get astounded by the fact that Android app is prone to repackaging. We can say that Android is negligent in such an attack. That\'s because of the intrinsical relation to the structural characteristics of the app distribution process. The app requires \\"ANY\\" valid signature to be successfully installed \u2014 they do not verify the actual identity of the signer. The app developer (even including the bad actor!) does not need a legitimate public key certificate issued by a trusted authority, indicating the possibility that an actor can modify an existing app, inject some harmful codes, and re-sign it with the self-generated private key. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when you have installed the repackaged app on your mobile device? Based on our experience,\\n\\n- Plifering cryptocurrencies\\n- Stealing your credentials (Account Information, Passport Copy for KYC, ...)\\n- Leaking your secret phrases\\n- Or... almost everything you can imagine is possible!\\n\\n## 2 helpful guidelines for giving the app a check\\n\\nWhether you\'re downloading an app as a customer or as a developer NOT via the official app store such as Google Play, there are some essential guidelines and tips that you need to consider to guarantee the safety of your device. Let\'s check them out!\\n\\n### Protip 1. Establish trust via download links.\\n\\nWhen reading a blog post, you may find they are hosting a third-party download. Clicking the button may lead to potential problems \u2014 you must validate the address beforehand. In the case of Binance, the address should be `https://download.binance.com/pack/BNApp.apk`, as shown in the picture below.\\n\\n![IMG-1](./1.png)\\n\\nBut remember, scammers are becoming more innovative and intelligent, and they can disguise the URL to make it look safe. The malicious URL can be various: `https://download.b1nance.com/` or `https://download.blnance.co/`. Although you find the post with no apparent problem, please proceed cautiously!\\n\\n### Protip 2. Check the digital signature.\\n\\nWith a tool called apksigner, you can check the app\'s authenticity. The apksigner tool, available in revision 24.0.3 and higher of the Android SDK Build Tools, lets you sign APKs and confirm that an APK\'s signature will be verified successfully on all Android platform-supported versions by that APK. Make a comparison between the original and repackaged versions \u2014 you may immediately sense the difference.\\n\\nThe syntax for confirming the successful verification of an APK\'s signature on supported platforms is as follows:\\n\\n`apksigner verify [options] app-name.apk`\\n\\nThe apksigner verify command has the following options.\\n\\n**--print-certs**\\n\\nShow information about the APK\'s signing certificates.\\n\\n**--min-sdk-version <integer\\\\>**\\n\\nThe lowest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK\'s signature will be verified. Higher values allow the tool to use more robust security parameters when signing the app but limit the APK\'s availability to devices running more recent versions of Android. By default, apksigner uses the value of the minSdkVersion attribute from the app\'s manifest file.\\n\\n**--max-sdk-version <integer\\\\>**\\n\\nThe highest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK\'s signature will be verified. By default, the tool uses the highest possible API level.\\n\\n**-v, --verbose**\\n\\nUse the verbose output mode.\\n\\n**-Werr**\\n\\nTreat warnings as errors.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nYou should only trust apps obtained from official app stores. Suppose you ever downloaded the Binance app from third-party markets or have already installed it. In that case, you are probably at risk \u2014 immediate action is required: change your password, factory reset your device, fresh-install it from our official host, and please contact us for assistance.\\n\\nOther apps also can be a potential backdoor. Once you use the repackaged app, the lousy actor can annoy you in countless programmatically unimaginable ways. Telegram is a good example: Hashdit once ever stumbled across an unofficial Telegram app replacing crypto wallet addresses with the bad actors\' ones on-the-fly."},{"id":"top-6-crypto-scams-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/hashdit/blog/top-6-crypto-scams-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-25/2022-11-25.md","title":"Top 6 Most Popular Crypto Scams In 2022","description":"Back in 2021, crypto scams were a growing attack vector tricking victims into investing in the crypto space.

According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/crypto-scams-cost-people-more-than-1-billion-since-2021-ftc.html), more than $1 billion were lost to crypto scams in 2021, where the most common types include fake investments and romance scams.  \\n\\nSince then, 2022 has shown that scammers are getting more and more creative.\\n\\nAs a leader in securing the BNB Chain ecosystem, it is our duty to keep users in the BNB Chain ecosystem safe by making sure they are always one step ahead of these scammers. Here are the most popular scams this year:\\n\\n### 1: Phishing Link Scams \\n\\nPhishing is already a popular technique used by scammers in Web 2. This is because scammers can just create a malicious website and subsequently mass send the links to their victims. Here, we will focus mostly on ways that the scammers will try to steal your private keys. \\n\\nIn Web 3, scammers usually send their phishing links through different mediums where the Web3 community is, like Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and even On-Chain.\\n\\n![IMG-2](./2.png)\\n\\nPhishing websites usually look like the real website, but with different url names. They can be about a new giveaway or NFT pre-mint events, basically any situation that will make the user feel excited (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out) and not think straight. The scammer takes advantage of the user\u2019s emotional instability.\\n\\nThey can blatantly be asking for the user to provide his seed phrase or private key. For example, contacting  users on  social media,reaching out as wallet software support and jumping in with direct messages spoofing as an Exchange Support to steal one\u2019s private key directly.\\n\\nAnother way is that scammers will develop chrome extensions that look similar to legitimate ones like Metamask. By impersonating the real applications, users often are led to letting their guard down and provide their private key to use the new application.\\n\\nOne interesting tactic we noticed is that scammers will also try to trick users into thinking there is a new bug/vulnerability with existing applications and there is a new software upgrade. We detected a scammer trying to trick users into thinking the current Metamask version had a bug and users should upgrade to the new version. The scammer proclaimed in the message that the new upgrade is not out yet so the upgrade has to be done manually this time. He afterwards gave a set of instructions which aims to trick the user into providing his metamask password which will expose his private key to the scammer.\\n\\nIn this scenario, users should always wait for the official announcement from Metamask and upgrade their Metamask version from official sources.\\n\\nTo upgrade an extension, just head to chrome://extensions/ \\n\\nClick on the update button\\n\\n![IMG-3](./3.png)\\n\\nThis will update all your extensions accordingly.\\n\\n##### A friendly reminder: \\nNormal application upgrades WILL NOT require a user to provide sensitive information such as login credentials. \\n\\n### 2: Ice-Phishing \\n\\nThis is a tactic where the user is tricked into signing a transaction that gives an attacker control over the user\u2019s tokens, without the leakage of his private keys. This is an extension of the Phishing technique.\\n\\nFor some background, when a user is using DeFi applications (e.g PancakeSwap) and interacting with the main token standards (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155) the approval method is shown on their metamask window. This is a request for the user to delegate authority to a 3rd party to act on behalf of that user on those tokens. Afterwards, the user can perform other operations like performing a swap.\\n\\nAttackers will direct users to the phishing website and induce them to sign some transactions that they didn\'t request. For example, the interacted contract might not even be a contract, but the attacker\u2019s address. Once the approval transaction is done, the attacker has the authority to transfer funds out of the victim\u2019s wallet.\\n\\nUsually, the scam website has an algorithm to scan the victim\u2019s wallet to detect the valuable assets such as an expensive BAYC NFT or cryptocurrencies like WBTC or WETH. Often, the website will continually show the metamask window to prompt users to sign another transaction even though they may have already signed once.\\n\\nAnother way to prevent being a victim of Ice-Phishing is to stay away from signing eth_sign transactions. They usually look something like this: \\n\\n![IMG-4](./4.png)\\n\\nThe method eth_sign is an open-ended signing method that allows signing an arbitrary hash, which means it can be used to sign unclear transactions, or any other data, making it a dangerous phishing risk.\\n\\nAn arbitrary hash here means that the usual suspects of approve or approve for all methods are not the only possible methods, the scammer can make you sign transactions like native token transfer or a contract call. Essentially, having almost full control of your account without even holding your private key!\\n\\nAlthough MetaMask will display a risk warning when signing eth_sign requests, when combined with other phishing techniques, it can still be possible for users with no security experience to fall for these traps.\\n\\n### 3: Event Spoofing & NFT Sleep Minting\\n\\n#### Event Spoofing\\n\\nEvent spoofing is a tactic where scammers transfer random BEP20 tokens to users, and prompt users to interact with it. The catch is that even though the scammer is the one transferring the tokens, from the blockchain explorer like BscScan, it will show that the source of funds were from a separate wallet such as Binance Hot Wallet. Then, they will be enticed to interact with these new \u2018free\u2019 tokens which can lead to users to phishing websites by displaying a link in the token name or the code itself. This is an extension of the Phishing technique.\\n\\nThis method takes advantage of how blockchain explorers show events. \\n\\nFor example, this screenshot from BscScan shows CHI being sent from Null Address to the address 0x7aa3\\n\\n![IMG-5](./5.png)\\n\\nFrom the code perspective, this means that at the line emit Transfer(...)\\n* msg.sender -> Null address (_from)\\n* _to -> 0x7aa3\\n* _value -> 294\\n\\n![IMG-6](./6.png)\\n\\nHowever, blockchain explorers will blindly use the parameters of the emit events. If the _from address is changed to another address for e.g 0xhashdit, then BscScan will display the CHI being sent from 0xhashdit to the receiving address. Note: this isn\u2019t particularly a bug with blockchain explorers, but more of the flexibility to change parameters since BscScan cannot know for sure whether the parameters are accurate. As such, scammers can use this to their advantage and spoof the source of funds.\\n\\nLook at our twitter [post](https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1557536292979855360) for such an example! \\n\\n#### NFT Sleep Minting\\n\\nBuilding on plain BEP20 event spoofing, scammers can be creative with how they execute their scam. NFT Sleep Minting is when a scammer mints an NFT directly to a famous creator\u2019s wallet. However, the NFT code has a backdoor method where the scammer can reclaim the NFT back. This creates the appearance that (1) the famous creator authentically minted an NFT to themselves; and then (2) sent that NFT to a scammer. Based on the \u201con-chain\u201d provenance, the scammer can claim they own an NFT minted by a famous creator and sell it for a higher value, faking the value in the process.\\n\\nThe deception of Sleep Minting comes from the fact that you can emit any piece of data in an Event log. One would expect that if the user sends a transaction to transfer an NFT, then your address should be in the Event log as the \u201cfrom\u201d field. However, that is not the case when a scammer reclaims a sleep-minted NFT from a famous creator. A scammer could artificially place the famous creator\u2019s address in a Transfer Events \u201cfrom\u201d field, completing the illusion.\\n\\nFor exmaple, we can take a look at Beeple\'s [account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6b0562605d35ee710138402b878ffe6f2e23807#tokentxnsErc721) and observe several NFTS minted to him, and not exactly minted by him.\\n\\n### 4: Ponzi Scams\\n\\nIn these scams, there is usually no real strategy to earn rewards or make profits. Essentially, the whole scheme uses the money of new investors to pay the old investors. Once there is no more new money coming in to support the scheme, the whole system will fail.\\n\\nThere are several telltale signs in a Crypto Ponzi Scam:\\n\\n##### First, the project side collects tax fees and these fees keep users longer in the ecosystem. \\nSince every deposit/compounding action incurs some sort of fees, this means that the user has to compound for a longer period of time in order to break even. These fees are also used to pay back the dividends of the users who want to claim. \\n\\n##### Second, there is no way to withdraw the user\'s initial invested funds. \\nOnce one user deposits their initial tokens, there is no way for him to withdraw back his initial invested funds. The only way for the user to get back any funds is to claim back dividends. \\n\\n##### The third way is using a referral system. \\nThe project encourages participants to actively promote and refer others through the referrer benefits. The upline will receive additional rewards whenever a downline performs certain actions. Also, in order for a user to start participating in the protocol, he has to have an upline address to start. This creates a system where each address is linked to another, similar to a pyramid scheme. There are increased bonuses for having more than 5 downline addresses too.\\n\\nA common theme that one will see is a steep rise in funds locked in the contract at the start, usually driven by the initial hype through marketing by the team or funds pumped by the team themselves to generate activity. Once the contract\u2019s balance has reached an inflection point, this means there are no new funds coming in. This will slowly result in the scheme falling apart and the new investors panicking to withdraw as much dividends as possible.\\n\\n![IMG-7](./7.png)\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the project party which solely earns the tax fees will be the biggest beneficiary for such Ponzi scam projects.\\n\\n### 5: CHI Gas token farming\\n\\nCHI Gas token is an initiative by 1inch project, where the Chi Gastoken is a BEP20 token that is meant to be used on 1inch exchange to pay transaction costs. Chi is pegged to the network\u2019s gas price. When the gas price is low, the Chi price is also low, and the opposite. \\n\\nHow scammers make use of this is very interesting. First, they would airdrop a bunch of random BEP20 tokens. When the user approves PancakeSwap to sell these tokens, in the approve() method of these tokens it will hard coded to consume a large amount (e.g above 90%) of the user\'s gas limit to mint Chi Gastoken which can be used to subsidize the gas fee, the minted Chi Gastoken are the profit of the scammers. \\n\\nIt is recommended to pay attention to the consumed condition of gas fee in approval transactions before calling the approve() function in some airdrop tokens.\\n \\n##### In general, don\u2019t touch random tokens airdropped to you\\n\\nLook at our twitter [post](https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1573330966969720835) for such an example!\\n\\n### 6: MEV Scams / Scam Events\\n\\n#### Crypto Jargon\\n\\nScammers will make use of crypto jargon like \u201cMEV (Maximal Extractable Value)\u201d, \u201cArbitrage trading bot\u201d, \u201cSniper bot\u201d, \u201cFront-run bot\u201d promising passive income of a few thousand dollars a day to entice users to participate. These are usually promoted on platforms like Twitter, Tiktok and Blockchain Explorers.\\n\\nUsually, scammers will attach a video link to the post where victims are brought to video hosting platforms like Youtube and Vimeo.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n![IMG-8](./8.png)\\n\\nEssentially, the scam video will guide the user to deploy their malicious code using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), they will provide the malicious code usually in a pastebin url in the video description. \\n\\n![IMG-9](./9.png)\\n\\nWith the code now deployed on-chain, the user will be instructed to next prepare some native funds to perform the \u2018front run or arbitrage\u2019. The scam video will prompt the user to prepare more native funds so that when you perform the \u2018front run or arbitrage\u2019 operation, you will be able to make more profits, tricking the user. Once the user injects the funds into the contract and \u2018starts the front run\u2019, instead of earning him profits like what the scammer claims to do, the funds will be directly transferred to the scammer\\n\\nAnother relatively new way is for scammers to provide a link for CEX (Centralized Exchange) trading bots such as the screenshot here.\\n\\n![IMG-10](./10.png)\\n\\nUsers will be prompted to download a malicious file and follow the instructions. Usually, users that want to trade on Binance Exchange automatically will have an API key. This scam video tricks users into using their trading bot and asking users to give up their API key and the password for it. Once the user is scammed into doing so, the scammer will be able to receive the user\u2019s credentials on their end and trade with the user\u2019s funds now.\\n\\n#### Crypto Event\\n\\nIn such situations, scammers also use social media to spread fake information of a giveaway being done by notable players in the space such as crypto exchanges or projects.\\n\\n![IMG-11](./11.png)\\n\\nUsers will be prompted to enter this link and are instructed to \u201cverify\u201d their address first. In order to so, they have to send some BTC or BNB to the specified address and in return they will get back 10x of the amount. At the same time, the scam website shows a transaction history of the giveaway records to trick users into thinking that the giveaway is real and works. However in reality, once the crypto is sent by the user, the funds will be lost to the scammer and there will be no rewards to receive in the end. \\n\\nOftentimes, scammers might use old videos or even resort to deep faking a popular figure, to trick users into thinking that the person is endorsing and promoting a new giveaway. When in reality, this cannot be further away from the truth.\\n\\nA common similarity among these cases is that there will be fake engagement in the video\u2019s comment section. This is to psychologically trick users into thinking that this trading bot really works well.\\n\\n![IMG-12](./12.png)\\n\\nAlso, if this is in the description, **RUN**. It is a HUGE red flag.\\n\\n![IMG-13](./13.png)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nScams will continue to grow in a decentralized environment such as crypto so it is critical for us to each be responsible for our own security. To beef up the security and safety of users in the BNB Chain, Hashdit has been partnering with ecosystem players such as PancakeSwap and AvengerDAO to detect scams as soon as possible. Moving forward, we will strive to build a safe ecosystem for both protocol users and smart contract developers on the BNB Chain. \\n\\nIf you found this article useful, please share it around on Twitter and tag us!

Rugged. Rugged.\\n\\nIf you are a DeFi investor, you have definitely heard of these words. As newly DeFi projects mushroom to BSC chain each day, not all of them are good \u2014\u2014 be careful, they might steal your investment! According to the 200 most recently launched DeFi project analysis in RugDoc, 28% of them are tagged as \u201cHigh Risk\u201d, which means that they are highly likely to lead to catastrophic losses as they are right now, and 29% of them are marked as \u201cSome Risk\u201d that have ability to perform soft rug, and only 43% of them are \u201cLow Risk\u201d or \u201cNo Risk\u201d.\\n\\nIn other words, there is more than 28% probability that you lost all your the investment on DeFi project (if you randomly picked one!). Such lost maybe due to ignorance, credulous, or lack of learning. So, how do you control the risk of investment in DeFi and how to identify whether the project has a high likelihood of screwing you over? This article helps you to spot a potential rug DeFi project by following some simple steps, which only takes around 10 minutes. Remember, scammers are becoming smarter and smarter and they are able to disguise their project to make it look safe. So, even if you find a project with no obvious problem \u2014\u2014 proceed with caution!\\n\\n### Step 1: Verify the contract you are interacting with\\n\\nWhen we enter a project\u2019s website, they may have a reference to which MasterChef contract you are interacting with. However, it might be a lie! The contract you are actually interacting with may be different to the one they posted on the website. To verify this, the most trustable way is to do a \u201ctest\u201d transaction: \\n\\n![IMG-1](./image_23-30-20.png)\\n\\n\\nTake MetaMask as an example, the contract you are actually interacting with is shown on the right corner. Copy it with a left click and check whether the contract address is the same as they show to you. Also make sure the contract source code is \u201cverified\u201d by BscScan (check whether there is a green mark above \u201cContract Name\u201d). \\n\\n(Verified contract has a green mark above \u201cContract Name\u201d)\\n\\n![IMG-2](./image_23-30-51.png)\\n\\n### Step 2: Check the \u201cowner\u201d of contracts\\n\\nIn a DeFi project, the MasterChef contract is the one who manages most operations, and you can verify the MasterChef contract by following step 1. However, MasterChef is super-powerful, and should not be owned by a regular address. Honest developers will create a Timelock contract to own the MasterChef, and each write operation by the owner to MasterChef will be delayed for a period of time, giving you time to take your investment out if developers made any mistake. On the other hand, evil scammers try to own the MasterChef themselves \u2014\u2014 so that they can take away your money in a second. Usually, the ownership graph between each contract is shown as follows: \\n\\n![IMG-3](./image_23-30-51.png)\\n\\nSuch verification can be done by reading the contract variable and verifying the addresses on BscScan. Let\u2019s walk through this process with an example of PancakeSwap:\\n\\n1. Find the PancakeSwap MasterChef (0x73feaa1ee314f8c655e354234017be2193c9e24e) on BscScan.com, and click on \u201cRead Contract\u201d. \\n\\n![IMG-4](./image_23-31-58.png)\\n\\n2. Find the \u201cowner\u201d variable of the MasterChef.\\n\\n![IMG-5](./image_23-32-53.png)\\n\\n3. Click on the address link, and we found that it is a Timelock contract.\\n\\n![IMG-6](./image_23-33-41.png)\\n\\n4. Next, find the Token contract in MasterChef, the PancakeSwap token is named \u201ccake\u201d. This might vary from projects. \\n\\n![IMG-7](./image_23-34-41.png)\\n\\n5. Click on it, and find whether the owner of \u201ccake\u201d is the MasterChef contract we came from. \\n\\n![IMG-8](./image_23-35-0.png)\\n\\n6. Compare the addresses, they are the same! Meaning that the PancakeSwap project is safe (for now), Hoo-Yeah!\\n\\nNote: When checking the Timelock and Token contracts, make sure that they are \u201cverified\u201d by BscScan!\\n\\n\\n### Step 3: Check upgradable proxy & Timelock duration\\n\\nIf a project\u2019s MasterChef uses \u201cupgradable proxy\u201d (if you don\u2019t know what is an upgradable proxy, Click Here), then its code is totally modifiable by its owners. For such powerful contract like MasterChef, you generally do not want it be easily changed \u2014\u2014 cause the developers may replace the original MasterChef with an evil one. Thus making sure the project\u2019s MasterChef do not use proxy is very important. When you clicking on the \u201cContract\u201d, you do NOT want to see these extra buttons: \\n\\n![IMG-9](./image_23-35-28.png)\\n\\nThe \u201cRead as Proxy\u201d and \u201cWrite as Proxy\u201d means that they are using upgradable proxy to deploy their contracts. It does not always mean the end of the world, but you would better ask the developers why did they do so \u2014\u2014 and they\u2019d better give a reasonable answer.\\n\\nIn the previous step, we told you to check the Timelock contract, but we also need to make sure that the Timelock is actually locking some \u201ctime\u201d! To verify this, we go to the \u201cRead Contract\u201d of Timelock: \\n\\n![IMG-10](./image_23-36-16.png)\\n\\nAs you can see here, the minimum delay of this Timelock is 21600 seconds, which is 6 hours, and the current delay is set to 21700 seconds. This mean that the developers\u2019 action will be delayed for at least 6 hours before they take actual effects. Generally, you want the minimum delay time to be set above 6 hours \u2014\u2014 to not worry about your investments while you are asleep.\\n\\n### Step 4: Check commonly evil features\\n\\nThere can be lots of evil code hiding inside the contracts, and finding all of them is super time-consuming. Luckily, there are some commonly-used evil features by the scammers, and if you find the project you are about to invest contains one, or multiple of the following code, be careful, you might get rugged!\\n\\n* (High Risk) If they have the \u201cmigrate\u201d function in MasterChef. (Except PancakeSwap)\\n* (High Risk) Search \u201cfee => 10000\u201d and see if they have any fee up to 100%.\\n* (High Risk) If they have \u201csetVaultAddress\u201d function in MasterChef.\\n* (High Risk) Go to their website, check whether \u201cTotal Value Locked\u201d matches the sum up from their Liquidity Pools.\\n* (Medium Risk) Check whether the number of \u201cpoolLength\u201d in MasterChef matches the actual pool numbers on their website.\\n* (Medium Risk) If they have \u201cupdateStartBlock\u201d function in MasterChef, it might causes severe bug to the project if not used correctly.\\n* (Medium Risk) If their code highly matched the Panther project (0x058451c62b96c594ad984370eda8b6fd7197bbd4), then proceed with caution because Panther itself have some \u201crisks\u201d due to operator privileges, and the newly started DeFi project are more tend to abuse them.\\n\\nWoo-hoo! You luckily find your target DeFi project \u201cpassed\u201d all the steps listed above and is going to dip into it\u2026. Wait a minute! Passing this 10-minute test does not mean that it is totally safe, if you want to invest your lifetime money into it, think twice! As I mentioned above, this guide only helps you to make sure that the project does not do an \u201cobvious rug\u201d, but what if the scammers are smart? Here are some extra assessments you can do to lower your risk:\\n\\n* Check the top token holders of the project, they usually are the burn address or the staking contract.\\n* Look deeper into the code and find if the dev is able to drain funds or unlimitedly emit new tokens to itself.\\n* Track the transactions and ask dev team for any odd moves you found. Good dev will always give you space to ask questions.\\n* Search on the twitter & any public rug scanning community about the project, if they have not done the review on it yet, submit a request.\\n* Find whether the contract code has any audit. They\u2019d better have one or two paid audits to prove their code security.\\n* Do not put all your eggs in one bucket, and never invest what you can\u2019t lose."}]}')}}]);
