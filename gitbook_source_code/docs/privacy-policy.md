# Privacy Policy

Hashdit (“Hashdit”, “we”, or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and we take our data protection responsibilities with the utmost seriousness.

This Privacy Notice describes how Hashdit collects and processes your personal data through the Hashdit websites and applications that are referenced in this Privacy Notice. Hashdit refers to an ecosystem comprising Hashdit websites (whose domain names include but are not limited to www.hashdit.io), clients, applets and other applications that are developed to offer Hashdit Services, and includes independently-operated platforms, websites and clients within the ecosystem.

# Our Collection of Personal Information

Sometimes we collect personal information automatically when an individual interacts with our Services and sometimes, we collect personal information directly from an individual. At times, we may collect personal information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.

If you choose not to share certain information with us, we may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you our Services. Any information you provide to us that is not required is voluntary.

**Blockchain participants**: Please note that by virtue of the public nature of the blockchain, including the Ethereum Blockchain, the holdings and transactions associated with your cryptocurrency wallet address will be publicly available and accessible to third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address (including, but not limited to, cryptographically secure non-fungible tokens, and other blockchain securitized tokens), the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on the blockchain may not be able to be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about the user’s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so. Please review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.

**Personal Information Collected from Individuals**

We may collect the following personal information submitted to us by individuals through the Services:

- **Contact Information**, such as your email address and social media handle.
- **Crypto Information**, including the website that the crypto transaction originated from, your public blockchain address associated with your self-hosted crypto wallet, crypto wallet types, amounts of digital assets and account balances.
- **Inquiry and Communications Information**, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms, to one of our email addresses, or via phone. This also includes information provided in order to subscribe to any of our newsletters or waitlist (such as email address).
- **Survey Information**, including any questions submitted through surveys or content of any testimonials.
- **Feedback Information**. We may also collect feedback and ratings you provide relating to our services or products. We use this information to communicate with you, to conduct market research, inform our marketing and advertising activities and improve and grow our business.
- **Employment Application Information**, including your contact and demographic information, educational and work history, employment interests, information obtained during interviews and any other information you choose to provide, if you apply for employment.

**Personal Information Automatically Collected**

As is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect personal information from an individual’s device, browsing actions and website usage patterns automatically when visiting or interacting with our Services, which may include log data (such as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our Services and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Services), analytics data (such as the electronic path taken to our Services, through our Services and when exiting our Services, as well as installations, usage, and activity on our Services) and location data (such as general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect).

We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to automatically collect this personal information.

To manage cookies, an individual may change their browser settings to: (i) notify them when they receive a cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact an individual’s experience using our Services, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all. Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser on each device they actively use. An individual may also set their email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether they have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

**Personal Information from Third Parties**

We also obtain personal information from third parties; which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.

We may receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following third parties:

- **Other Users or Individuals** who Interact with our Services: We may receive your information from other users or other individuals who interact with our Services. For example, if you engage in one of our communities hosted on third-party platforms, such as Discord and Telegram, we will be able to see any public communications made within that platform.
- **Service Providers**: Our service providers that perform services solely on our behalf, such as website and service operators, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us.
- **Social Media**: When an individual interacts with our Services through various social media networks, such as when someone logs in through a social network, or follows us on Twitter, or other social networks, we may receive some information about individuals that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the social network, and may include your profile information, profile picture, gender, username, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services.

Such information may include contact information, social media account information, general location, domains, cryptocurrency wallet address and related information, NFT ownership information (e.g., account address, transfers of NFTs between accounts), the corresponding smart contracts transactions paid and metadata describing each transaction and its properties as a digital asset, transaction recipient information (including cryptocurrency and NFT assets), and interest-in-services information, employment-related information, and interest-in-services information.
