### Key themes on high risks:

1. **Red Alarm projects** are manually identified by our security team for being potential scams. These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this [page](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)(31%)

2. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a privileged role, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some **centralization** risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 31% of the total newly identified risky addresses.

3. A quarter of the newly identified risky addresses (25%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs. 

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/10052023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.

Tip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.

## Integrations with PancakeSwap
Hashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBayâ€™s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.


Example: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1

Please take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.
